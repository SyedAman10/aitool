The biggest visual change has been the\nreplacement of the Office 2003 Command Line (File Edit View Insert\u2026) for The Ribbon. The Office\nButton in Office 2007 has gone away and replaced by the File Tab. These features will be described in\nthe following pages.\nThe \u2018W\u2019 Button The Ribbon The Help Button\nThe Quick Access Toolbar\nThe File Tab The Minimize Ribbon Button\n2\nThe W Button\nThis button was removed in Office 2007 and makes its return in 2010. This button is convenient in that\nyou can Minimize, Maximize or Close Word without having to traverse your mouse across the entire\nscreen to the right corner to perform these same actions. With our monitors getting larger, this is a nice\nfeature.\n3\nThe Minimize Ribbon Button\nWhile reading over a document, it may be convenient at times to minimize the Ribbon. To minimize, just\nclick on the \u2018up arrow\u2019 symbol.\nTo maximize the Ribbon, click on the \u2018down arrow\u2019 symbol.\n4\nThe File Tab\nThe File tab is basically the same look as the File command for Office 2003 users. You will still see the\nsame commands such as, Save, Save As, New, Print, etc. For Office 2007 users, the Office Button has\ngone away and has been replaced by the File tab. Here, you will still find the basic file commands. The\nscreen below is the default with Info being highlighted in the left column and the right side giving you\nmore information about your document like file size, number of words and pages.\n5\nThe Quick Access Toolbar\nThe Quick Access Toolbar is located in the upper left corner and is intended to store the buttons you will\nuse most often.\nBy default, the Quick Access Toolbar shows the Save, Undo, and Redo buttons, however if you click on\nthe drop down arrow just to the right, you can customize it to fit your needs. In the example below, I\nhave added the Quick Print button. The Save icon (which appears as a floppy diskette symbol) is\nconvenient to click on when wanting to save your work instead of clicking on the Save icon from the File\ntab.\n6\nThe Ribbon\nThe Ribbon is designed to replace the menus and toolbars of Office 2003. The goal of the Ribbon is to\nkeep commands visually up front so that they are easy to access as you work.\nThe Ribbon is divided into what are called Groups (Clipboard, Font, Paragraph and Styles, etc.). Each\nGroup has a triangular icon in the lower right hand corner. Clicking this will bring up an additional menu\nwindow. For example, clicking the triangle in the Font group brings up the classic Font options window.\nYou will find that most\nof your needs can be\nfound right on the\nRibbon Group itself.\n7\nThe Help Button\nThere is so much that Word can do in the latest version that it\u2019s hard to know everything. If you want\ninformation on a topic, click on the \u2018?\u2019 symbol in the upper right hand corner and the Help window will\nappear like below. You will see common topics to click on or you can type in a word or question in the\nsearch field to find further information.\n8\nCreate a Document\nGetting started with a basic document in Microsoft Word 2010 is as easy as opening Word and\nbeginning to type. Or, if you want to create an additional document besides the one you already have\nopened, click on the File tab, click on New in the left column, then double click on Blank document and\na new document window will appear.\nYou can also start a document from a template from the New view as well. There are many to download\nand choose from if you are on the Internet from Office.com like Letters, Flyers and Forms. If there is no\nInternet connection, you may choose from the Sample templates under Available Templates.\n9\nSpelling and Grammar Mistakes\nAs you type, Word will warn you if make spelling or grammar mistakes by inserting a wavy red, green, or\nblue underline beneath the text that it thinks is an error. Red underline: This indicates either a possible\nspelling error or that Word doesn\u2019t recognize a word, such as a proper name or place. Green underline:\nWord thinks that grammar should be revised. Blue underline: A word is spelled correctly but does not\nseem to be the correct word for the sentence. For example, you type \u201ctoo,\u201d but the word should be\n\u201cto.\u201d\nYou right click an underlined word to see the suggested revisions. Click a revision to replace the word in\nthe document and get rid of the underlines.\nA note of caution about green and blue underlines: Word is really good at spelling, which is pretty\nstraightforward most of the time. But grammar and correct word usage take some judgment.\nIf you think that you are right, and Word is wrong, then you can right-click the word and ignore the\nsuggested revisions and get rid of the underlines.\n10\nParagraph and Text Formatting\nWord 2010 assumes some defaults when you start a new document. For instance, there is no\nindentation on paragraphs and the line or sentence spacing is set by the default Style called Normal.\nLine Spacing (the space\nbetween each sentence) can\nbe tightened up by choosing\nthe No Spacing option on the\nStyles group.\nIf Indentation is needed, click\nthe triangle on the Paragraph\ngroup. Under Indentation,\nSpecial, choose First Line.\nParagraphs can have Bullets\nor Numbering added. Hover\nthe cursor over any button\nproduces a description.\nClicking the button will\nexecute the feature.\n11\nText alignment is also available on the Paragraph group. The default is Align Text Left which is\nhighlighted. The other options are Center, Align Text Right and Justify which is a clean look with text\naligned on both margins.\nText can easily be color highlighted or colored. Highlight the text first with your cursor then click on the\nFont Color button and the text will change to the default of red. To change the font color, click on the\ndown arrow for the color palette and choose your color. To color highlight your text, highlight the text\nwith your cursor, click on the Text Highlight Color button and it changes to the default of yellow. To\nchange the highlight color, click on the down arrow for the color palette and choose your color.\n12\nOpen an Existing File\nTo open an existing file you\u2019ve created, click on the File tab, click the Open button and the familiar Open\ndialog box appears as seen in the next screen shot below.\nClick on the file you want, then click Open at the bottom right.\n13\nSaving Files Part I\nWhile editing an existing file, it\u2019s a good habit to often save your work. There are two different ways to\nsave files. Click the File tab, then just click the Save button. The faster option as described earlier, is to\nclick the Save button in the Quick Access Toolbar.\n14\nSaving Files Part II\nWhen editing an existing document, you may want to save the file under a different name. Click on the\nFile tab, click the Save As button and the Save As dialog box opens as seen below. In the File name field,\ntype in the new name without changing the .docx extension. Click the Save button.\n15\nFile Tab with Recent Option\nThe Recent option on the File tab allows you to quickly go to your other documents and open them. If\nyou accidently deleted a document or closed Word by mistake, you can recover your documents by\nclicking on the Recover Unsaved Documents button at the bottom of the page.\n16\nThe File Tab with Print Option\nThe Print option will be one of the most common choices on the File tab. The example below shows\nsome nice features. Here you can choose Orientation for Potrait or Landscape jobs, Double sided\nprinting, Paper Size, etc. When choosing Print with previous Word versions, the Print dialog box would\nopen and you need to click on Properties to find these needs. With this default Print window, all these\nchoices are listed plus others! If you want to print a particular page, ensure you are on that page, click\non the File tab, then click on Print All Pages for the drop down menu and select Print Current Page. If\nyou have more than one printer, click on the button under Printer for the drop down menu, and select\nyour printer.\nIf there are no special requirements, you just click on the square Print box in the upper left corner.\n17\nFile Tab Save & Send Option\nThere is a nice email feature on the Save & Send option under the File tab. You can choose to send your\ndocument as an email attachment. Clicking the Send as Attachment button causes a new Outlook email\nbox to open with your Word file attached! You can also choose to send it as a PDF file by clicking the\nSend as PDF button. You may also choose to save your document as a PDF file by clicking the Create\nPDF/XPS Document button.\n18\nFile Tab Help Option\nYou may also find Help with Word 2010 under the File tab.

We want to hear from you!\nMicrosoft is interested in hearing your feedback so we can continually improve our books and learning resources\nfor you. To participate in a brief online survey, please visit:\nmicrosoft.com/learning/booksurvey\n\nIntroducing Microsoft\nPowerPoint 2010\nMicrosoft PowerPoint 2010 is a full-featured presentation program that helps you quickly\nand efficiently develop dynamic, professional-looking presentations and then deliver\nthem to an audience. You can use PowerPoint to:\n\u25cf Introduce an idea, proposal, organization, product, or process with professionally\ndesigned, high-impact slides.\n\u25cf Use themes, galleries of styles, and formatting options to achieve the right combi-\nnation of colors, fonts, and effects.\n\u25cf Bolster your arguments by easily adding pictures, shapes, and fancy display text.\n\u25cf Convey numeric data in easy-to-grasp ways with styled tables or visually compelling\ncharts.\n\u25cf Use the SmartArt Graphics tool to create sophisticated diagrams that reflect pro-\ncesses, hierarchies, and other relationships.\n\u25cf Create custom themes, designs, and layouts so that your presentations have a\nunique look and feel.\n\u25cf Collaborate with colleagues, giving and receiving feedback to ensure the best\npossible presentation.\nPowerPoint 2010 builds on previous versions to provide powerful tools for all your pre-\nsentation needs. This introduction provides an overview of new features that we explore\nthroughout the book.\nNew Features\nIf you\u2019re upgrading to PowerPoint 2010 from a previous version, you\u2019re probably most\ninterested in the differences between the old and new versions and how they will affect\nyou, as well as how to find out about them in the quickest possible way. The following\nsections list new features you will want to be aware of, depending on the version\nof PowerPoint you are upgrading from.\nix\nx Introducing Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\nIf You Are Upgrading from PowerPoint 2007\nIf you have been using PowerPoint 2007, you might be wondering how Microsoft could\nhave improved on what seemed like a pretty comprehensive set of features and tools.\nThe list of new features includes the following:\n\u25cf The Backstage view Finally, all the tools you need to work with your files, as\nopposed to their content, really are accessible from one location. You display the\nBackstage view by clicking the File tab, which replaces the Microsoft Office Button\nat the left end of the ribbon.\n\u25cf Customizable ribbon The logical next step in the evolution of the command cen-\nter introduced with PowerPoint 2007: Create your own tabs and groups to suit the\nway you work.\n\u25cf A window for each presentation You no longer display all presentations in the\nsame window, so you can arrange open presentations for easy comparison or\nwork on different presentations at the same time.\n\u25cf Reading view This new way to preview presentations makes it easy to quickly\ncheck the effect of one or two changes.\n\u25cf Presentation videos Now turning a presentation into a Windows Media Video is\na simple matter of saving in that format.\n\u25cf Paste preview No more trial and error when moving items to new locations.\nPreview what an item will look like in each of the available formats, and then pick\nthe one you want.\n\u25cf Animation Painter If you spend time developing a complex animation for one\nobject, you can now copy the animation settings to another object with a few\nmouse clicks.\n\u25cf New themes and transitions Adding pizzazz to your presentations is just a matter\nof applying a professional-looking theme or a snazzy dynamic-content transition.\n\u25cf Graphics editing Found the perfect picture, but its colors or style aren't quite right\nfor your presentation? Now after inserting a picture, you can edit it in new ways.\nIn addition to changing color, brightness, and contrast, you can remove the back-\nground and, most exciting of all, apply artistic effects that make it appear like a\nwatercolor, pencil drawing, or pastel sketch.\nIntroducing Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 xi\n\u25cf Improved cropping Not only can you drag crop handles to manually crop a\npicture but you can also apply a built-in cropping ratio and then move the crop-\nping \"window\" around over the picture until you get precisely the part you want.\n\u25cf Text effects WordArt has had a makeover. You can still use WordArt to create\ndistinctive headlines, but now you can use its effects on any selected text.\n\u25cf Screenshots You no longer need to go outside of PowerPoint when you want to\ninsert a screenshot into a slide. This capability is now built into Word.\n\u25cf Improved SmartArt Graphics tool A whole new category has been added to\nSmartArt so that you can include pictures as well as text in your diagrams.\n\u25cf Video tools Found a perfect video, but it is too long to include in a presenta-\ntion? Now you can insert the video and then use the video editing tools built into\nPowerPoint to trim and format it. You can also insert a link to a video on a Web\nsite into a slide.\n\u25cf Version merging You can merge two versions of the same presentation and\naccept or reject changes.\n\u25cf Team collaboration Team members can now work simultaneously on a presenta-\ntion stored on a Microsoft SharePoint 2010 server or in Windows Live SkyDrive.\n\u25cf Broadcasting You can review a presentation with colleagues via the Web by work-\ning through a free broadcasting service. Your colleagues can view the presentation\nin their Web browsers and give feedback via a conference call.\n\u25cf Language support If you need to conduct business internationally across language\nlines, you can easily tailor the language of your working environment. You can also\nuse new translation tools to collaborate with team members in other countries.\n\u25cf Unsaved file recovery How many times have you responded No without thinking\nto the \"save changes\" message when closing files, only to find that you have dis-\ncarded work you wanted to keep? PowerPoint now preserves your unsaved files\nfor a period of time, allowing you to recover them if you need them.\nxii Introducing Microsoft PowerPoint 2010\nIf You Are Upgrading from PowerPoint 2003\nIn addition to the features listed in the previous section, if you\u2019re upgrading from\nPowerPoint 2003, you\u2019ll want to take note of the new features that were introduced in\nPowerPoint 2007. The 2007 upgrade provided a more efficient working environment\nand included a long list of new and improved features, including the following:\n\u25cf The Microsoft Office Fluent Ribbon No more hunting through menus, submenus,\nand dialog boxes. This new interface organizes all the commands most people use\nmost often, making them quickly accessible from tabs at the top of the program\nwindow.\n\u25cf Live Preview See the effect of a style, theme, or other option before you apply it.\n\u25cf Custom layouts Easily create your own layouts with placeholders for specific\nobjects, and then save them for use in other presentations.\n\u25cf SmartArt Graphics tool Use this awesome new diagramming tool to create sophis-\nticated diagrams with 3-D shapes, transparency, drop shadows, and other effects.\n\u25cf Improved charting Enter data in a linked Microsoft Excel worksheet and watch as\nyour data is instantly plotted in the chart type of your choosing.\n\u25cf Slide libraries Share slide content with team members in a special SharePoint\nlibrary for presentations and slides.\n\u25cf Presentation cleanup Have PowerPoint check for and remove comments, hidden\ntext, and personal information stored as properties before you declare a presenta-\ntion final.\n\u25cf New file format The new Microsoft Office Open XML Formats reduce file size and\nhelp avoid loss of data.\nLet\u2019s Get Started!\nWe\u2019ve been working with PowerPoint since its debut, and each version has offered\nsomething that made daily presentation creation a little easier. Microsoft PowerPoint\n2010 is no exception, and we look forward to showing you around.\nModifying the Display of the Ribbon\nThe goal of the Microsoft Office 2010 working environment is to make working with\nOffice files\u2014including Microsoft Word documents, Excel workbooks, PowerPoint pre-\nsentations, Outlook e-mail messages, and Access databases\u2014as intuitive as possible. You\nwork with an Office file and its contents by giving commands to the program in which\nthe document is open. All Office 2010 programs organize commands on a horizontal bar\ncalled the ribbon, which appears across the top of each program window whether or not\nthere is an active document.\nRibbon tabs Ribbon groups\nA typical program window ribbon.\nCommands are organized on task-specific tabs of the ribbon, and in feature-specific\ngroups on each tab. Commands generally take the form of buttons and lists. Some\nappear in galleries. Some groups have related dialog boxes or task panes that contain\nadditional commands.\nThroughout this book, we discuss the commands and ribbon elements associated with\nthe program feature being discussed. In this topic, we discuss the general appearance\nof the ribbon, things that affect its appearance, and ways of locating commands that\naren\u2019t visible on compact views of the ribbon.\nSee Also For detailed information about the ribbon in Microsoft PowerPoint, see\n\u201cWorking in the User Interface\u201d in Chapter 1, \u201cExplore PowerPoint 2010.\u201d\nTip Some older commands no longer appear on the ribbon, but are still available in the\nprogram. You can make these commands available by adding them to the Quick Access\nToolbar. For more information, see \u201cCustomizing the Quick Access Toolbar\u201d in Chapter 15,\n\u201cCustomize PowerPoint.\u201d\nxiii\nxiv Modifying the Display of the Ribbon\nDynamic Ribbon Elements\nThe ribbon is dynamic, meaning that the appearance of commands on the ribbon\nchanges as the width of the ribbon changes. A command might be displayed on the\nribbon in the form of a large button, a small button, a small labeled button, or a list\nentry. As the width of the ribbon decreases, the size, shape, and presence of buttons\non the ribbon adapt to the available space.\nFor example, when sufficient horizontal space is available, the buttons on the Review\ntab of the Word program window are spread out and you\u2019re able to see more of the\ncommands available in each group.\nSmall labeled button\nDrop-down list Large button\nThe Review tab of the Word program window at 1024 pixels wide.\nIf you decrease the width of the ribbon, small button labels disappear and entire groups\nof buttons hide under one button that represents the group. Click the group button to\ndisplay a list of the commands available in that group.\nGroup button Small unlabeled buttons\nThe Review tab of the Word program window at 675 pixels wide.\nWhen the window becomes too narrow to display all the groups, a scroll arrow appears\nat its right end. Click the scroll arrow to display hidden groups.\nModifying the Display of the Ribbon xv\nScroll arrow\nThe Review tab of the Word program window at 340 pixels wide.\nChanging the Width of the Ribbon\nThe width of the ribbon is dependent on the horizontal space available to it, which\ndepends on these three factors:\n\u25cf The width of the program window Maximizing the program window provides\nthe most space for ribbon elements. You can resize the program window by\nclicking the button in its upper-right corner or by dragging the border of a\nnon-maximized window.\nTip On a computer running Windows 7, you can maximize the program window by\ndragging its title bar to the top of the screen.\n\u25cf Your screen resolution Screen resolution is the size of your screen display expressed\nas pixels wide \u00d7 pixels high. The greater the screen resolution, the greater the\namount of information that will fit on one screen. Your screen resolution options\nare dependent on your monitor. At the time of writing, possible screen resolutions\nrange from 800 \u00d7 600 to 2048 \u00d7 1152. In the case of the ribbon, the greater the\nnumber of pixels wide (the first number), the greater the number of buttons that\ncan be shown on the ribbon, and the larger those buttons can be.\nOn a computer running Windows 7, you can change your screen resolution from\nthe Screen Resolution window of Control Panel.\nxvi Modifying the Display of the Ribbon\nYou set the resolution by dragging the pointer on the slider.\n\u25cf The density of your screen display You might not be aware that you can change\nthe mag nification of everything that appears on your screen by changing the screen\nmagnification setting in Windows. Setting your screen magnification to 125% makes\ntext and user interface elements larger on screen. This increases the legibility of\ninformation, but means that less fits onto each screen.\nOn a computer running Windows 7, you can change the screen magnification from\nthe Display window of Control Panel.\nModifying the Display of the Ribbon xvii\nYou can choose one of the standard display magnification options, or create another by\nsetting a custom text size.\nThe screen magnification is directly related to the density of the text elements on\nscreen, which is expressed in dots per inch (dpi) or points per inch (ppi). (The terms\nare interchangeable, and in fact are both used in the Windows dialog box in which\nyou change the setting.) The greater the dpi, the larger the text and user interface\nelements appear on screen. By default, Windows displays text and screen elements\nat 96 dpi. Choosing the Medium - 125% display setting changes the dpi of text\nand screen elements to 120 dpi. You can choose a custom setting of up to 500%\nmagnification, or 480 dpi, in the Custom DPI Setting dialog box.\nYou can choose a magnification of up to 200% from the lists, or choose\na greater magnification by dragging across the ruler from left to right.\nxviii Modifying the Display of the Ribbon\nSee Also For more information about display settings, refer to Windows 7 Step by Step\n(Microsoft Press, 2009), Windows Vista Step by Step (Microsoft Press, 2006), or Windows XP\nStep by Step (Microsoft Press, 2002) by Joan Lambert Preppernau and Joyce Cox.\nAdapting Exercise Steps\nThe screen images shown in the exercises in this book were captured at a screen resolu-\ntion of 1024 x 768, at 100% magnification, and the default text size (96 dpi). If any of\nyour settings are different, the ribbon on your screen might not look the same as the one\nshown in the book. For example, you might see more or fewer buttons in each of the\ngroups, the buttons you see might be represented by larger or smaller icons than those\nshown, or the group might be represented by a button that you click to display the\ngroup\u2019s commands.\nWhen we instruct you to give a command from the ribbon in an exercise, we do it in this\nformat:\n\u25cf On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, click the Chart button.\nIf the command is in a list, we give the instruction in this format:\n\u25cf On the Page Layout tab, in the Page Setup group, click the Breaks button and\nthen, in the list, click Page.\nThe first time we instruct you to click a specific button in each exercise, we display an\nimage of the button in the page margin to the left of the exercise step.\nIf differences between your display settings and ours cause a button on your screen to\nlook different from the one shown in the book, you can easily adapt the steps to locate\nthe command. First, click the specified tab. Then locate the specified group. If a group\nhas been collapsed into a group list or group button, click the list or button to display\nthe group\u2019s commands. Finally, look for a button that features the same icon in a larger\nor smaller size than that shown in the book. If necessary, point to buttons in the group\nto display their names in ScreenTips.\nIf you prefer not to have to adapt the steps, set up your screen to match ours while you\nread and work through the exercises in the book.\nFeatures and Conventions\nof This Book\nThis book has been designed to lead you step by step through all the tasks you\u2019re most\nlikely to want to perform in Microsoft PowerPoint 2010. If you start at the beginning\nand work your way through all the exercises, you will gain enough proficiency to be\nable to create and work with most types of PowerPoint presentations. However, each\ntopic is self contained. If you have worked with a previous version of PowerPoint, or if\nyou completed all the exercises and later need help remembering how to perform a\nprocedure, the following features of this book will help you locate specific information:\n\u25cf Detailed table of contents Search the listing of the topics and sidebars within\neach chapter.\n\u25cf Chapter thumb tabs Easily locate the beginning of the chapter you want.\n\u25cf Topic-specific running heads Within a chapter, quickly locate the topic you\nwant by looking at the running heads at the top of odd-numbered pages.\n\u25cf Glossary Look up the meaning of a word or the definition of a concept.\n\u25cf Keyboard Shortcuts If you prefer to work from the keyboard rather than with\na mouse, find all the shortcuts in one place.\n\u25cf Detailed index Look up specific tasks and features in the index, which has been\ncarefully crafted with the reader in mind.\nYou can save time when reading this book by understanding how the Step by Step series\nshows exercise instructions, keys to press, buttons to click, and other information.\nxix\nxx Features and Conventions of This Book\nConvention Meaning\nSET UP This paragraph preceding a step-by-step exercise indicates the prac-\ntice files that you will use when working through the exercise.

If you do run into\nproblems, please contact the sources listed in the following sections.\nGetting Help with This Book\nIf your question or issue concerns the content of this book or its practice files, please\nfirst consult the book\u2019s errata page, which can be accessed at:\nhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=192149\nThis page provides information about known errors and corrections to the book. If\nyou do not find your answer on the errata page, send your question or comment to\nMicrosoft Press Technical Support at:\nmspinput@microsoft.com\nGetting Help with PowerPoint 2010\nIf your question is about Microsoft PowerPoint 2010, and not about the content of this\nbook, your first recourse is the PowerPoint Help system. This system is a combination of\ntools and files stored on your computer when you installed PowerPoint and, if your com-\nputer is connected to the Internet, information available from Office.com. You can find\ngeneral or specific Help information in the following ways:\n\u25cf To find out about an item on the screen, you can display a ScreenTip. For example, to\ndisplay a ScreenTip for a button, point to the button without clicking it. The ScreenTip\ngives the button\u2019s name, the associated keyboard shortcut if there is one, and unless\nyou specify otherwise, a description of what the button does when you click it.\n\u25cf In the PowerPoint program window, you can click the Microsoft PowerPoint Help\nbutton (a question mark in a blue circle) at the right end of the ribbon to display\nthe PowerPoint Help window.\n\u25cf After opening a dialog box, you can click the Help button (also a question mark)\nat the right end of the dialog box title bar to display the PowerPoint Help window.\nSometimes, topics related to the functions of that dialog box are already identified\nin the window.\nxxv\na08g626911.indd 25 4/11/11 4:59 PM\nxxvi Getting Help\nTo practice getting help, you can work through the following exercise.\nSET UP You don\u2019t need any practice files to complete this exercise. Start PowerPoint,\nand then follow the steps.\n1. At the right end of the ribbon, click the Microsoft PowerPoint Help button.\nThe PowerPoint Help window opens.\nYour Help window might look different from this one because the\nmaterial on the Office.com Web site is constantly being updated.\nTip You can maximize the window or adjust its size by dragging the handle in the lower-\nright corner. You can change the size of the font by clicking the Change Font Size button\non the toolbar.\nGetting Help xxvii\n2.

You\ninserted pictures and clip art images, created a diagram, plotted data in a chart, drew\nshapes, and eased the transition from one slide to another with a graphic effect. These\nsimple techniques might be all you need to enhance your presentations. But if you\nneed to manipulate graphic elements to produce more dramatic effects, you can push\nthe Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2010 capabilities further to get just the result you are\nlooking for.\nIn this chapter, you\u2019ll create a photo album and insert and manipulate photographs.\nNext, you\u2019ll manipulate shapes to customize an organization chart. Then you\u2019ll format a\nchart and save it as a template. Finally, you\u2019ll use various techniques to arrange graphics.\nPractice Files Before you can complete the exercises in this chapter, you need to copy\nthe book\u2019s practice files to your computer. The practice files you\u2019ll use to complete the\nexercises in this chapter are in the Chapter08 practice file folder. A complete list of\npractice files is provided in \u201cUsing the Practice Files\u201d at the beginning of this book.\n195\n196 Chapter 8 Fine-Tune Visual Elements\nEditing Pictures\nFrom time to time in this book, we have alluded to the modern trend away from slides\nwith bullet points and toward presentations that include more graphics. Successful\npresenters have learned that most people can\u2019t listen to a presentation while they are\nreading slides. So these presenters make sure most of their slides display graphics that\nrepresent the point they are making, giving the audience something to look at while\nthey focus on what is being said.\nPowerPoint 2010 gives you the tools you need to create graphic-intensive rather than\ntext-intensive presentations. When you want to display a dynamic array of pictures in\na presentation, you can use a photo album template to do the initial layout and then\ncustomize the album by adding frames of different shapes, as well as captions.\nTip To integrate the slide layouts from a photo album template into a more traditional\npresentation, create the photo album and then import its slides into the other presentation\nby clicking Reuse Slides at the bottom of the New Slide gallery. For information about reusing\nslides, see \u201cAdding Slides with Ready-Made Content\u201d in Chapter 2, \u201cWork with Slides.\u201d\nAfter you insert any picture into a presentation, you can modify it by using the buttons\non the Format tab that is displayed on the ribbon only when the graphic is selected. For\nexample, you can do the following:\n\u25cf Remove the background by clicking the Remove Background button and then\ndesignating either the areas you want to keep or those you want to remove.\n\u25cf Sharpen or soften the picture, or change its brightness or contrast, by choosing\nthe effect you want from the Corrections gallery.\n\u25cf Enhance the picture\u2019s color by making a selection from the Color gallery.\n\u25cf Make one of the picture\u2019s colors transparent by clicking Set Transparent Color at\nthe bottom of the gallery and then selecting the color.\n\u25cf Choose an effect, such as Pencil Sketch or Paint Strokes, from the Artistic Effects\ngallery.\n\u25cf Apply effects such as shadows, reflections, and borders, or apply combinations\nof these effects by choosing a predefined style from the Picture Styles gallery.\n\u25cf Add a border consisting of one or more solid or dashed lines of whatever width\nand color you choose.\n\u25cf Rotate the picture to any angle, either by dragging the green rotating handle or\nby clicking the Rotate button and then choosing a rotating or flipping option.\n\u25cf Crop away the parts of the picture that you don\u2019t want to show on the slide.\n(The picture itself is not altered\u2014parts of it are simply covered up.)\nEditing Pictures 197\n\u25cf Minimize the presentation\u2019s file size by clicking the Compress Pictures button and\nthen choosing where or how the presentation will be viewed\u2014for example, on\nthe Web or printed\u2014to determine the optimum resolution. You can also delete\ncropped areas of a picture to reduce file size.\nIn this exercise, you\u2019ll create a photo album displaying pictures of native plants. You\u2019ll\ncrop, resize, remove the background, apply an artistic effect, and add captions.\nYou\u2019ll also reuse a slide from another photo album, and apply a theme.\nSET UP You need the NativePlant1 through NativePlant8 photographs and the\nPhotoAlbumTitleSlide presentation located in your Chapter08 practice file folder to\ncomplete this exercise. Open a blank presentation, and then follow the steps.\n1. On the Insert tab, in the Images group, click the Photo Album button.\nThe Photo Album dialog box opens.\n2. Under Insert picture from, click File/Disk.\nThe Insert New Pictures dialog box opens.\n3. Navigate to your Chapter08 practice file folder, click NativePlant1, hold down\nthe Ctrl key, and click NativePlant3 through NativePlant5. Then click Insert.\nThe Photo Album dialog box now has four graphics files listed in the Pictures In\nAlbum list.\nYou can click each picture in turn to view it in the Preview box.\n198 Chapter 8 Fine-Tune Visual Elements\n4. In the Pictures in album list, click NativePlant4, and then click the Move Up\nbutton to make it the second picture in the list.\n5. Preview the pictures in turn, and then click the Contrast and Brightness buttons\nas necessary to give the four photographs a more even tone.\nYou could also adjust the rotation of a picture, but in this case, that is not necessary.\n6. In the Album Layout area, display the Picture layout list, and click 2 pictures.\n7. Display the Frame shape list, click Rounded Rectangle. Then click Create.\nPowerPoint creates a presentation called Photo Album that contains a title slide\nand two slides each containing two pictures.\nOn the title slide, PowerPoint inserts the user name stored in the PowerPoint Options\ndialog box.\nTroubleshooting The appearance of buttons and groups on the ribbon changes\ndepending on the width of the program window. For information about changing the\nappearance of the ribbon to match our screen images, see \u201cModifying the Display of\nthe Ribbon\u201d at the beginning of this book.\n8. Save the presentation as My Photo Album.\n9. Display Slide 2, and click the photo on the left. Then on the Format contextual tab,\nin the Size group, click the Crop arrow. In the list, point to Aspect Ratio, and then\nunder Portrait, click 2:3.\nEditing Pictures 199\nPowerPoint crops away parts of the picture, leaving a centered \u201cwindow\u201d over the\nphoto, sized to the proportions you specified.\nCropping handles surround the active area so that if you want, you\ncan adjust the cropped areas.\n10. Click the photo on the right, and then repeat the cropping process in step 9.\n11. In turn, select each photo, and drag the upper-left and bottom-right corner\nhandles until the photos occupy the majority of the space on the slide.\nTip When sizing the photo on the right, release the mouse button when the dotted\nguide appears, letting you know that the photo is aligned with the photo on the left.\n12. Display slide 3, and crop the photo on the left to Square, 1:1. Then point inside\nthe crop window, and drag to the left until the cropping window is centered on\nthe flower.\nPowerPoint maintains the size of the crop window but moves the photo under\nthe window to the left.\nThe image of the flower is centered in the crop window.\n200 Chapter 8 Fine-Tune Visual Elements\n13. Click the photo on the right, and in the Size group, use the down arrow to reduce\nthe height to 3\u201d. Then crop the photo to Square, 1:1, adjusting the crop window\nso that all of the flower is showing.\n14. Enlarge and align the photos so that they occupy the entire width of the slide.\n15. Click the left photo, and in the Adjust group, click the Remove Background\nbutton.\nThe Background Removal contextual tab appears, and PowerPoint marks the\nareas of the photo that will be removed.\nThe thumbnail on the Slides tab shows what the flower will look like after its background\nis removed.\n16. Drag the handles on the frame surrounding the flower until the entire flower is\nvisible within the frame. Then in the Close group, click the Keep Changes button.\n17. Repeat steps 15 and 16 to remove the background of the photo on the right. Then\nclick a blank area of the slide.\nThe background is removed from both flower photos.\nEditing Pictures 201\nThe flowers stand out vividly against the plain slide background.\n18.

Often, you will need nothing more than these\nbasic techniques to be able to convey your numeric data in a visual format. However,\nfor those times when you need more than a basic chart, PowerPoint provides formatting\ncapabilities that enable you to produce just the effect you want.\nIf you decide that the type of chart you selected doesn\u2019t adequately depict the most\nimportant characteristics of your data, you can change the type at any time. There are\n11 chart types, each with two-dimensional and three-dimensional variations, and you\ncan customize each aspect of each variation. Common chart types include the following:\n\u25cf Column charts Used to show how values change over time.\n\u25cf Bar charts Used to show the values of several items at one point in time.\n\u25cf Line graphs Used to show erratic changes in values over time.\n\u25cf Pie charts Used to show how parts relate to the whole.\nIf you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time on a chart, you can apply the predefined com-\nbinations of formatting from the Chart Layouts and Chart Styles groups on the Design\ncontextual tab to create sophisticated charts with a minimum of effort. However, if you\nwant more control over the appearance of your chart, you can use the options on the\nLayout and Format contextual tabs. It is worth exploring these options so that you know\nhow to do the following:\n\u25cf Add shapes and pictures.\n\u25cf Format individual elements such as titles, axes, data labels, and gridlines.\n\u25cf Add trend lines, bars, and other lines.\n\u25cf Customize the walls and floor or otherwise manipulate a three-dimensional chart.\n\u25cf Customize the look of shapes.\n\u25cf Add and format fancy text (WordArt).\n\u25cf Arrange objects precisely.\n\u25cf Precisely control the overall size of the chart.\nYou can double-click almost any chart object to change its attributes. For example, you\ncan double-click an axis to display the Format Axis dialog box, where you can change\nthe scale, tick marks, label position, line style, and other aspects of the axis. If you have\ntrouble double-clicking some of the smaller chart elements, you can select the element\nyou want to format from the Chart Elements list in the Current Selection group on the\n208 Chapter 8 Fine-Tune Visual Elements\nFormat tab, and then click the Format Selection button in the same group to display the\nFormat dialog box for the selection.\nIf you make extensive modifications, you might want to save the customized chart as a\ntemplate so that you can use it for plotting similar data in the future without having to\nrepeat all the changes.\nIn this exercise, you\u2019ll modify the appearance of a chart by changing its chart type and\nstyle. You\u2019ll change the color of the plot area and the color of two data series. You\u2019ll then\nhide gridlines and change the layout to display titles and a datasheet. After adding an\nannotation in a text box, you\u2019ll save the chart as a template.\nSET UP You need the LandscapingChart_start presentation located in your Chapter08\npractice file folder to complete this exercise. Open the LandscapingChart_start presen-\ntation, and save it as LandscapingChart. Then follow the steps.\n1. Display slide 14, and click the blank area above the chart legend to activate the\nchart without selecting any of its elements.\nTroubleshooting Be sure to click a blank area inside the chart frame. Clicking any of its\nelements will activate that element, not the chart as a whole.\nPowerPoint displays the Design, Layout, and Format contextual tabs.\n2.

Then save and close the LandscapingChart presentation.\nArranging Graphics\nAfter inserting pictures or drawing shapes in the approximate locations you want them\non a slide, you can align them and change their stacking order by clicking the buttons in\nthe Arrange group on the Format contextual tab.\nArranging Graphics 215\nClicking the Align button gives you access to commands for aligning individual or\nmultiple graphics in several ways. For example, you can:\n\u25cf Align graphics vertically by the left or right edges or centerline, or horizontally\nby the top or bottom edges or centerline.\n\u25cf Distribute graphics evenly within their current space, either horizontally or\nvertically.\n\u25cf Align graphics relative to the slide that contains them or to other selected objects.\n\u25cf Align graphics relative to a position on the slide.\n\u25cf Align graphics against gridlines and adjustable horizontal and vertical guides.\nTip If you added pictures to a slide by clicking the Picture button in the Images group on the\nInsert tab, you can group them and then align and position them as a group the same way\nyou would group shapes. However, if you have added them by clicking the Insert Picture From\nFile button in a content placeholder, you cannot group them. For information about grouping\nshapes, see \u201cDrawing Shapes\u201d in Chapter 5, \u201cAdd Simple Visual Enhancements.\u201d\nWhen graphics overlap each other, they are stacked. The stacking order is determined\nby the order in which you inserted the graphic. You can change the stacking order by\nselecting a graphic and then clicking the Bring Forward or Send Backward button to\nmove the graphic to the top or bottom of the stack. To move the selected graphic forward\nin the stack one graphic at a time, click the Bring Forward arrow and then click Bring To\nFront in the list; to move it backward, click Send To Back in the Send Backward list.\nTip If you can\u2019t select a graphic because it is covered by others in the stack, click the Selection\nPane button to display the Selection And Visibility task pane, and then select the graphic you\nwant from the Shapes On This Slide list.\nIn this exercise, you\u2019ll align graphics in various ways, change their stacking order, and\nposition them with the help of a grid and guidelines.\nSET UP You need the GardenResidents_start presentation located in your Chapter08\npractice file folder to complete this exercise.

That information can be in the form of text, graphics, charts, and tables,\nbut it might also consist of audio content. And sometimes the best way to ensure that\nyour audience understands your message is to show a video. For example, if your com-\npany has developed a short advertising video, it makes more sense to include the video\nin a presentation about marketing plans than to try and describe it with bullet points or\neven pictures.\nIn this chapter, you\u2019ll insert a sound clip and a sound file and make various adjustments\nto their settings. You\u2019ll also insert two video files, edit one of them, and format them both.\nPractice Files Before you can complete the exercises in this chapter, you need to copy\nthe book\u2019s practice files to your computer. The practice files you\u2019ll use to complete\nthe exercises in this chapter are in the Chapter11 practice file folder.

We want to hear from you!\nMicrosoft is interested in hearing your feedback so we can continually improve our books and learning resources\nfor you. To participate in a brief online survey, please visit:\nmicrosoft.com/learning/booksurvey\n\nIntroducing Microsoft Access 2010\nMicrosoft Access 2010 is a powerful relational database program that includes hundreds\nof tools you can use to quickly start tracking, sharing, and reporting information, even\nif you are new to database development. Users have access to a large library of profes-\nsionally designed templates; wizards that automatically create tables, forms, queries,\nand reports; and extensive local and online help resources.\nAccess supports sharing data with other sources, including other Microsoft Office 2010\nprograms, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows SharePoint Services, and documents in XML,\nHTML, XPS, and PDF formats. Advanced features allow you to create sophisticated executable\ndatabase applications that your employees and customers can use to gather and view\ndata without needing to know anything at all about database design or development.\nThis book gives you straightforward instructions for using Access to create databases.\nIt takes you from knowing little or nothing about Access\u2014or, for that matter, about\ndatabases\u2014to a level of expertise that will enable you to create complex databases\nfor use by one person or by many people.\nNew Features\nIf you\u2019re upgrading to Access 2010 from a previous version, you\u2019re probably more\ninterested in the differences between the old and new versions and how they will\naffect you than you are in the basic functionality of Access. To help you identify the\nentire scope of changes from the version of Access you\u2019re familiar with, we\u2019ve listed\nhere the new features introduced in Access 2010, as well as in Access 2007.\nix\nx Introducing Microsoft Access 2010\nIf You Are Upgrading from Access 2007\nIf you have been using Access 2007, you might be wondering how Microsoft could have\nimproved on what seemed like a pretty comprehensive set of features and tools. In addition\nto enhancing many of the new features introduced with Access 2007, Access 2010 includes\nthe following new features:\n\u25cf The Backstage view Finally, all the tools you need to work with your files, as opposed\nto their content, really are accessible from one location. You display the Backstage\nview by clicking the File tab, which replaces the Microsoft Office Button at the left\nend of the ribbon.\n\u25cf Customizable ribbon The logical next step in the evolution of the command\ncenter introduced with Access 2007: Create your own tabs and groups to suit\nthe way you work.\n\u25cf Unifying themes Adding pizzazz to database objects such as forms and reports is\njust a matter of applying a professional-looking theme from a gallery of options.\n\u25cf Web capabilities Companies that have employees and clients in different geographic\nlocations can publish databases to Access Services, thereby making those databases\naccessible over the Internet in a Web browser.\n\u25cf Navigation forms Offering the sophisticated browsing techniques people are accus-\ntomed to using on Web sites, these new forms provide an essential navigation tool\nfor Web databases, and can also increase the usability of non-Web databases.\n\u25cf New database templates Getting started with the creation of common types of\ndatabases has never been easier. The databases that come with Access are supple-\nmented by those made available by a community of database developers through\nMicrosoft Office Online.\n\u25cf Application parts You can now add predefined database objects to an existing\ndatabase. In addition to 10 types of forms, several Quick Start parts are available.\nFor example, adding the Contacts part adds one table and associated queries,\nforms, and reports.\n\u25cf Enhanced Layout view and layout controls It is now easier to make design changes\nin Layout view while actively viewing the underlying data.\n\u25cf Enhanced Expression Builder The layout of the Expression Builder dialog box has\nbeen refined to make building an expression more intuitive. In addition, a feature\ncalled IntelliSense has been incorporated to display options based on what you\ntype and to provide syntax guidance.\nIntroducing Microsoft Access 2010 xi\n\u25cf Improved conditional formatting You can now use data bars to add at-a-glance\ninsight into the data in Number fields.\n\u25cf Ability to export to PDF and XPS files When you want to make a report or other\ndatabase object available to people but don\u2019t want them to be able to manipulate\nit, you can export the object in either PDF or XPS format. You can optimize the file\nsize for printing or publishing online.\nIf You Are Upgrading from Access 2003\nAccess 2010 builds on Access 2007, which introduced a long list of new and improved\nfeatures that made it easier than ever to create databases to track, share, manage, and\naudit information, including the following:\n\u25cf The ribbon The new user interface organizes the most common commands for\nany database object into tabs and groups so that the appropriate commands are\nimmediately accessible for the current object.\n\u25cf Quick Access Toolbar Customize a portion of the toolbar to include commands\nyou regularly use, regardless of which object is currently active.\n\u25cf Navigation pane The customizable Navigation pane replaces the Database window\nfrom Access 2003. You can display or hide all tables, queries, forms, reports, macros,\nand modules, or create a custom group that displays only the objects you want to\nwork with at the moment. You can even hide the Navigation pane to make more\nroom on the screen for your database object.\n\u25cf View Shortcuts toolbar This context-sensitive toolbar at the lower-right corner of\nthe program window provides single-click switching among the supported views\nof the current database object. Quickly switch between Datasheet view, Design\nview, PivotTable view, PivotChart view, Form view, Layout view, Report view, and\nother views appropriate to the current object.\n\u25cf Tabbed documents Open multiple database objects and switch between them\nquickly by clicking tabs on a tab bar.\n\u25cf Template library Quickly locate and download professionally designed templates\nfor common database projects.\n\u25cf Improved sorting and filtering Easily sort all records in a table based on one or\nmore fields, or filter a table or form to display or hide records matching multiple\ncriteria.\nxii Introducing Microsoft Access 2010\n\u25cf Layout view Redesign a form or report while viewing it.\n\u25cf Stacked and Tabular layouts Group controls in a form or report layout so you\ncan easily manipulate the entire group as one unit.\n\u25cf Automatic calendar The Date/Time data type includes an optional calendar\ncontrol. Click the calendar, and select the date you want.\n\u25cf Rich Text Memo fields now support most common formatting options, including\nfonts, color, and character formatting. The formatting is stored with the database.\n\u25cf Create tab Quickly create a new table, form, query, report, macro, SharePoint list,\nor other Access object.\n\u25cf Totals function Add a totals row to a query, and select from a list of formulas to\nautomatically calculate aggregate values for forms and reports.\n\u25cf Field List Drag and drop fields from one or more related or unrelated tables onto\nyour active table.\n\u25cf Attachment data type Attach photos and other files to a database record.\n\u25cf Embedded macros Macros embedded in a form or report offer a higher level\nof security in database applications.\n\u25cf Microsoft Access Help Easily search end-user and developer help content from\nwithin Access.\n\u25cf Improved information sharing Easily import and export data between Access and\nother Office applications or XML, HTML, PDF, and dBase files; collect information\nthrough e-mail surveys in Microsoft Office Outlook and automatically update your\ndatabase with the responses; create or link a database with a SharePoint list; or pub-\nlish your database to a SharePoint library and allow users to update and extract\ninformation.\n\u25cf Improved report design Quickly create a professional-looking report, complete with\nlogo, header, and footer; and use Report view, combined with filters, to browse only\nselected records in the report.\n\u25cf Group, Sort, and Total pane This feature makes it much easier to group and sort\ndata in reports, and add totals from a drop-down list.\n\u25cf Enhanced security Adding password protection to a database now causes Access\nto automatically encrypt the database when it closes, and decrypt it when it\nopens.\nIntroducing Microsoft Access 2010 xiii\nLet's Get Started!\nThere are so many new and improved features to this already feature-rich program\nthat there are bound to be some exciting discoveries for even the most advanced users.\nIf you are new to Access, you will find many automated features that let you painlessly\ncreate databases and add queries, forms, and professional-looking reports to track and\nshare your data. We look forward to showing you around Microsoft Access 2010.\n\nModifying the Display of the Ribbon\nThe goal of the Microsoft Office 2010 working environment is to make working with Office\nfiles\u2014including Microsoft Word documents, Excel workbooks, PowerPoint presentations,\nOutlook e-mail messages, and Access databases\u2014as intuitive as possible. You work with\nan Office file and its contents by giving commands to the program in which the docu-\nment is open. All Office 2010 programs organize commands on a horizontal bar called\nthe ribbon, which appears across the top of each program window whether or not there\nis an active document.\nRibbon tabs Ribbon groups\nA typical program window ribbon.\nCommands are organized on task-specific tabs of the ribbon, and in feature-specific\ngroups on each tab. Commands generally take the form of buttons and lists. Some appear\nin galleries in which you can choose from among multiple options. Some groups have\nrelated dialog boxes or task panes that contain additional commands.\nThroughout this book, we discuss the commands and ribbon elements associated with\nthe program feature being discussed. In this section, we discuss the general appearance\nof the ribbon, things that affect its appearance, and ways of locating commands that\naren\u2019t visible on compact views of the ribbon.\nSee Also For detailed information about the ribbon in Microsoft Access, see \u201cWorking\nin Access 2010\u201d in Chapter 1, \u201cExplore an Access 2010 Database.\u201d\nTip Some older commands no longer appear on the ribbon, but are still available in the\nprogram. You can make these commands available by adding them to the Quick Access\nToolbar. For more information, see \u201cCustomizing the Quick Access Toolbar\u201d in Chapter 13,\n\u201cCustomize Access.\u201d\nxv\nxvi Modifying the Display of the Ribbon\nDynamic Ribbon Elements\nThe ribbon is dynamic, meaning that the appearance of commands on the ribbon\nchanges as the width of the ribbon changes. A command might be displayed on the\nribbon in the form of a large button, a small button, a small labeled button, or a list\nentry. As the width of the ribbon decreases, the size, shape, and presence of buttons\non the ribbon adapt to the available space.\nFor example, when sufficient horizontal space is available, the buttons on the Review\ntab of the Word program window are spread out and you\u2019re able to see more of the\ncommands available in each group.\nDrop-down list Small labeled button Large button\nThe Review tab of the Word program window at 1024 pixels wide.\nIf you decrease the width of the ribbon, small button labels disappear and entire groups\nof buttons are hidden under one button that represents the group. Click the group button\nto display a list of the commands available in that group.\nGroup button Small unlabeled buttons\nThe Review tab of the Word program window at 675 pixels wide.\nModifying the Display of the Ribbon xvii\nWhen the window becomes too narrow to display all the groups, a scroll arrow appears\nat its right end. Click the scroll arrow to display hidden groups.\nScroll arrow\nThe Review tab of the Word program window at 340 pixels wide.\nChanging the Width of the Ribbon\nThe width of the ribbon is dependent on the horizontal space available to it, which\ndepends on these three factors:\n\u25cf The width of the program window Maximizing the program window provides\nthe most space for ribbon elements. You can resize the program window by\nclicking the button in its upper-right corner or by dragging the border of a\nnon-maximized window.\nOn a computer running Windows 7, you can maximize the program window by\ndragging its title bar to the top of the screen.\n\u25cf Your screen resolution Screen resolution is the amount of information your screen\ndisplays, expressed as pixels wide by pixels high. The greater the screen resolution, the\ngreater the amount of information that will fit on one screen. Your screen resolution\noptions are dependent on your monitor. At the time of writing, possible screen reso-\nlutions range from 800 \u00d7 600 to 2048 \u00d7 1152. In the case of the ribbon, the greater\nthe number of pixels wide (the first number), the greater the number of buttons that\ncan be shown on the ribbon, and the larger those buttons can be.\nxviii Modifying the Display of the Ribbon\nOn a computer running Windows 7, you can change your screen resolution from\nthe Screen Resolution window of Control Panel.\nYou set the resolution by dragging the pointer on the slider.\n\u25cf The density of your screen display You might not be aware that you can change the\nmagnification of everything that appears on your screen by changing the screen mag-\nnification setting in Windows. Setting your screen magnification to 125% makes text\nand user interface elements larger on screen. This increases the legibility of informa-\ntion, but it means that less information fits onto each screen.\nOn a computer running Windows 7, you can change the screen magnification from\nthe Display window of Control Panel.\nSee Also For more information about display settings, refer to Windows 7 Step by Step\n(Microsoft Press, 2009), Windows Vista Step by Step (Microsoft Press, 2006), or Windows\nXP Step by Step (Microsoft Press, 2002) by Joan Lambert Preppernau and Joyce Cox.\nModifying the Display of the Ribbon xix\nYou can choose one of the standard display magnification options or create another by setting\na custom text size.\nThe screen magnification is directly related to the density of the text elements on\nscreen, which is expressed in dots per inch (dpi) or points per inch (ppi). (The terms\nare interchangeable, and in fact are both used in the Windows dialog box in which\nyou change the setting.) The greater the dpi, the larger the text and user interface\nelements appear on screen. By default, Windows displays text and screen elements\nat 96 dpi. Choosing the Medium - 125% display setting changes the dpi of text and\nscreen elements to 120 dpi. You can choose a custom setting of up to 500 percent\nmagnification, or 480 dpi, in the Custom DPI Setting dialog box.\nYou can choose a magnification of up to 200 percent from the lists, or choose a greater\nmagnification by dragging the ruler from left to right.\nxx Modifying the Display of the Ribbon\nAdapting Exercise Steps\nThe screen images shown in the exercises in this book were captured at a screen reso-\nlution of 1024 \u00d7 768, at 100% magnification, and with the default text size (96 dpi).\nIf any of your settings are different, the ribbon on your screen might not look the same\nas the one shown in the book. For example, you might see more or fewer buttons in\neach of the groups, the buttons you see might be represented by larger or smaller\nicons than those shown, or the group might be represented by a button that you\nclick to display the group\u2019s commands.\nWhen we instruct you to give a command from the ribbon in an exercise, we do it in\nthis format:\n\u25cf On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, click the Chart button.\nIf the command is in a list, we give the instruction in this format:\n\u25cf On the Page Layout tab, in the Page Setup group, click the Breaks button\nand then, in the list, click Page.\nThe first time we instruct you to click a specific button in each exercise, we display\nan image of the button in the page margin to the left of the exercise step.\nIf differences between your display settings and ours cause a button on your screen to\nnot appear as shown in the book, you can easily adapt the steps to locate the command.\nFirst, click the specified tab. Then locate the specified group. If a group has been collapsed\ninto a group list or group button, click the list or button to display the group\u2019s commands.\nFinally, look for a button that features the same icon in a larger or smaller size than that\nshown in the book. If necessary, point to buttons in the group to display their names in\nScreenTips.\nIf you prefer not to have to adapt the steps, set up your screen to match ours while you\nread and work through the exercises in the book.\nFeatures and Conventions\nof This Book\nThis book has been designed to lead you step by step through all the tasks you\u2019re\nmost likely to want to perform in Microsoft Access 2010. If you start at the beginning\nand work your way through all the exercises, you will gain enough proficiency to be\nable to manage complex databases through Access. However, each topic is self con-\ntained. If you have worked with a previous version of Access, or if you completed all\nthe exercises and later need help remembering how to perform a procedure, the\nfollowing features of this book will help you locate specific information:\n\u25cf Detailed table of contents Scan the listing of the topics and sidebars within\neach chapter.\n\u25cf Chapter thumb tabs Easily locate the beginning of each chapter by looking\nat the colored blocks on the odd-numbered pages.\n\u25cf Topic-specific running heads Within a chapter, quickly locate a topic by looking\nat the running heads at the top of odd-numbered pages.\n\u25cf Glossary Look up the meaning of a word or the definition of a concept.\n\u25cf Keyboard Shortcuts If you prefer to work from the keyboard rather than with\na mouse, find all the shortcuts in one place.\n\u25cf Detailed index Look up specific tasks and features in the index, which has been\ncarefully crafted with the reader in mind.\nxxi\nxxii Features and Conventions of This Book\nYou can save time when reading this book by understanding how the Step by Step series\nshows exercise instructions, keys to press, buttons to click, and other information. These\nconventions are listed in the following table.\nConvention Meaning\nSET UP This paragraph preceding a step-by-step exercise indicates the practice\nfiles that you will use when working through the exercise. It also indicates\nany requirements you should attend to or actions you should take before\nbeginning the exercise.\nCLEAN UP This paragraph following a step-by-step exercise provides instructions\nfor saving and closing open files or programs before moving on to\nanother topic. It also suggests ways to reverse any changes you made\nto your computer while working through the exercise.\n1 Numbered steps guide you through hands-on exercises in each topic,\nas well as procedures in sidebars and expository text.\n2\nSee Also This paragraph directs you to more information about a topic in this\nbook or elsewhere.\nTroubleshooting This paragraph alerts you to a common problem and provides guidance\nfor fixing it.\nTip This paragraph provides a helpful hint or shortcut that makes working\nthrough a task easier.\nImportant This paragraph points out information that you need to know to\ncomplete a procedure.\nKeyboard Shortcut This paragraph provides information about an available keyboard\nshortcut for the preceding task.\nCtrl+B A plus sign (+) between two keys means that you must press those\nkeys at the same time. For example, \u201cPress Ctrl+B\u201d means that you\nshould hold down the Ctrl key while you press the B key.\nPictures of buttons appear in the margin the first time the button is\nused in an exercise.\nBold In exercises that begin with SET UP information, bold type displays\ntext that you should type; the names of program elements, such as\nbuttons, commands, windows, and dialog boxes; and files, folders, or\ntext that you interact with in the steps.\nUsing the Practice Files\nBefore you can complete the exercises in this book, you need to copy the book\u2019s practice\nfiles to your computer.

If you do run into\nproblems, please contact the sources listed in the following sections.\nGetting Help with This Book\nIf your question or issue concerns the content of this book or its practice files, please\nfirst consult the book\u2019s errata page, which can be accessed at:\nhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=192153\nThis page provides information about known errors and corrections to the book. If\nyou do not find your answer on the errata page, send your question or comment to\nMicrosoft Press Technical Support at:\nmspinput@microsoft.com\nGetting Help with Access 2010\nIf your question is about Microsoft Access 2010, and not about the content of this book,\nyour first recourse is the Access Help system. This system is a combination of tools and\nfiles stored on your computer when you installed Access and, if your computer is con-\nnected to the Internet, information available from the Microsoft Office Online Web site.\nYou can find general or specific Help information in the following ways:\n\u25cf To find out about an item on the screen, you can display a ScreenTip. For example, to\ndisplay a ScreenTip for a button, point to the button without clicking it. The ScreenTip\ngives the button\u2019s name, the associated keyboard shortcut if there is one, and some-\ntimes a description of what the button does when you click it.\n\u25cf In the Access program window, you can click the Microsoft Access Help button (a\nquestion mark in a blue circle) at the right end of the ribbon to display the Access\nHelp window.\n\u25cf At the right end of the title bars of some dialog boxes is a Help button (also a question\nmark) that you can click to display the Access Help window. Sometimes, topics related\nto the functions of that dialog box are already identified in the window.\nxxv\nxxvi Getting Help\nTo practice getting help, you can work through the following exercise.\nSET UP You don\u2019t need any practice files to complete this exercise. Start Access,\nand then follow the steps.\n1. At the right end of the ribbon, click the Microsoft Access Help button.\nThe Access Help window opens.\nYour Help window might look different from this one because the material on the\nOffice Online Web site is constantly being updated.\nTip You can maximize the window or adjust its size by dragging the handle in the\nlower-right corner. You can change the size of the font by clicking the Change Font\nSize button on the toolbar.\n2. Toward the bottom of the window, below the bulleted list under Browse Access\n2010 support, click see all.\nGetting Help xxvii\nTroubleshooting The See All link is available only if the Search option is set to one of\nthe Content From Office.com choices. If your Search option is set to one of the Content\nFrom This Computer choices, the complete list is already displayed.

Only the displayed\ninformation is printed.\nCLEAN UP Click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the Access Help\nwindow.\nMore Information\nIf your question is about Access 2010 or another Microsoft software product and you\ncannot find the answer in the product\u2019s Help system, please search the appropriate\nproduct solution center or the Microsoft Knowledge Base at:\nsupport.microsoft.com\nIn the United States, Microsoft software product support issues not covered by the\nMicrosoft Knowledge Base are addressed by Microsoft Product Support Services.\nLocation-specific software support options are available from:\nsupport.microsoft.com/gp/selfoverview/\n\nChapter at a Glance\nCreate databases\nfrom templates,\npage 46\nCreate databases\nand tables\nmanually, page 52\nRefine table\nstructure,\npage 64\nCreate relationships\nbetween tables, page 68\n2\nCreate Databases\nand Simple Tables\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to\n\u2714 Create databases from templates.\n\u2714 Create databases and tables manually.\n\u2714 Manipulate table columns and rows.\n\u2714 Refine table structure.\n\u2714 Create relationships between tables.\nCreating the container for a database is easy. But an empty database is no more useful\nthan an empty document or worksheet. It is only when you fill a database with data in\ntables (known as populating a database) that it starts to serve a purpose. As you add\nforms, queries, and reports, it becomes a useful tool. If you customize it by adding a\nstartup page and organizing the various objects into categories and groups, it moves\ninto the realm of being a database application.\nNot every database has to be refined to the point that it can be classified as an application.\nDatabases that only you or a few experienced database users will work with can remain\nfairly simple. But if you expect someone without database knowledge to enter data or\ngenerate their own reports, spending a little extra time in the beginning to create a solid\nfoundation will save a lot of work later. Otherwise, you\u2019ll find yourself continually repairing\ndamaged files or walking people through seemingly easy tasks.\nMicrosoft Access 2010 takes a lot of the difficult and mundane work out of creating and\ncustomizing a database by providing database applications in the form of templates that\nyou modify and populate with your own information. Access 2010 also provides templates\nfor common elements that you might want to plug into a database. These application\nparts consist of sets of objects\u2014a table and related forms, queries, or reports\u2014that\ntogether provide a complete, functioning part of a database. All you have to do is fill in\nyour data. If none of the templates meet your needs, you can create tables manually.\n45\n46 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\nIn this chapter, you\u2019ll create a database from a template and create a table manually.\nThen you\u2019ll adjust the display of a data table to fit your needs. By the end of this chapter,\nyou\u2019ll have a database containing a few tables and you\u2019ll understand a bit about how\nthe tables in the databases you will use for the exercises in the remaining chapters of the\nbook were created.\nPractice Files You don\u2019t need any practice files to complete the exercises in this chapter.\nFor more information about practice file requirements, see \u201cUsing the Practice Files\u201d at\nthe beginning of this book.\nCreating Databases from Templates\nA few years ago (the distant past, in computer time), creating a database structure involved\nfirst analyzing your needs and then laying out the database design on paper. You would\ndecide what information you needed to track and how to store it in the database. Creating\nthe database structure could be a lot of work, and after you created it and entered data,\nmaking changes could be difficult. Templates have changed this process, and committing\nyourself to a particular database structure is no longer the big decision it once was.\nA template is a pattern that you use to create a specific type of database. Access 2010\ncomes with templates for several databases typically used in business and education, and\nwhen you are connected to the Internet, many more are available from the Microsoft\nOffice Online Web site at office.microsoft.com. By using pre-packaged templates, you\ncan create a database application in far less time than it used to take to sketch the\ndesign on paper, because someone has already done the design work for you.\nUsing an Access template might not produce exactly the database application you want,\nbut it can quickly create something that you can customize to fit your needs. However, you\ncan customize a database only if you know how to manipulate its basic building blocks:\ntables, forms, queries, and reports. Due to the complexity of these templates, you probably\nshouldn\u2019t try to modify them until you\u2019re comfortable working with database objects in\nDesign view and Layout view. By the time you finish this book, you will know enough to be\nable to confidently work with the sophisticated pre-packaged application templates that\ncome with Access.\nIn this exercise, you\u2019ll create a database application based on the Tasks template. This\ntemplate is typical of those provided with Microsoft Access 2010, in that it looks nice\nand demonstrates a lot of the neat things you can do in a database.\nCreating Databases from Templates 47\nSET UP You don\u2019t need any practice files to complete this exercise. Close any open\ndatabases, and then with the New page of the Backstage view displayed, follow\nthe steps.\n1. In the Available Templates area, click Sample Templates.\nAccess displays a list of the templates that shipped with the program and are\ninstalled on your computer.\n2. Click the Tasks template icon.\nIn the right pane, you can assign a name to the database and browse to the location\nwhere you want to store the database.\nThe Tasks template is supplied with Access.\n3. In the File Name box, type MyTasks.\nTip Naming conventions for Access database files follow those for Windows files. File\nnames cannot contain the following characters: \\ / : * ? \u201c < > |. By default, file name\nextensions are hidden, and you shouldn\u2019t type the extension in the File Name box.\n(The extension for an Access 2010 database file is .accdb. For information about this\nfile format, which was introduced with Access 2007, search for accdb in Access Help.)\n48 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\n4. Click the adjacent Browse button, and then in the File New Database dialog box,\nnavigate to your Chapter02 practice file folder.\nYou use the same navigational techniques in this dialog box that you would use in\nany Open or Save dialog box.\nThe File New Database dialog box.\n5. With Microsoft Access 2007 Databases selected in the Save as type box,\nclick OK.\nThe path to the specified folder is displayed below the File Name box.\nTip By default, Access creates new databases in your Documents folder. You can change\nthe location when you create each database, as you did here, or you can change the\ndefault save folder. To specify a different default folder, click the File tab to display\nthe Backstage view, click Options, and then on the General page of the Access Options\ndialog box, under Creating Databases, click the Browse button to the right of Default\nDatabase Folder. In the Default Database Path dialog box, browse to the folder you\nwant to be the default, and then click OK in each of the open dialog boxes.\nCreating Databases from Templates 49\n6. Click the Create button.\nAccess briefly displays a progress bar, and then the new database opens, with the\nTask List form displayed in Layout view.\nTip Below the form name is a toolbar with commands created by embedded macros.\nThese commands are an example of what makes this a database application rather\nthan a simple database. The topic of macros is beyond the scope of this book. For\ninformation, search for macros in Access Help.\n7. If the Navigation pane is closed, click the Shutter Bar Open button at the right\nend of its title bar to open it. Then if any of the groups are collapsed, click their\nchevrons to open them.\nThe Navigation pane displays a custom Tasks Navigation category.\nThe custom category has custom Tasks, Contacts, and Supporting Objects groups.\nTroubleshooting The appearance of buttons and groups on the ribbon changes depending\non the width of the program window. For information about changing the appearance of\nthe ribbon to match our screen images, see \u201cModifying the Display of the Ribbon\u201d at the\nbeginning of this book.\n50 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\n8. In the Navigation pane, click the Tasks Navigation title bar, and then in the\ncategory and group list, click Object Type to list all the objects in this database.\n9. In the Tables group, double-click Contacts.\nThe empty Contacts table is displayed. You could now start entering data in this\ntable.\n10. Right-click the Contacts tab, and click Close All.\n11. On the Create tab of the ribbon, in the Templates group, click the Application\nParts button.\nThe Application Parts gallery appears.\nThe Application Parts gallery.\nYou can add various types of forms and several sets of related tables and other\ndatabase objects to this or any other database. These ready-made objects give\nyou a jump start on creating a fully functional database application.\n12. Click away from the gallery to close it.\n13. Continue exploring the objects that are part of the MyTasks database on\nyour own.\nCLEAN UP Close the MyTasks database.\nCreating Databases from Templates 51\nWeb Databases\nSeveral of the templates in the Sample Templates gallery and many of the templates\navailable from the Microsoft Office Online Web site are designated as Web data-\nbases. A Web database is one that is compatible with the new Web publishing\ncapabilities of Access 2010.\nIf Access Services are installed on your organization\u2019s Microsoft SharePoint server,\nyou can now publish a database to Access Services. Publishing converts tables to\nSharePoint lists stored on the server and makes it possible to work with the data-\nbase either in Access or in a Web browser.\nYou can create a Web database based on a Web template or build a new one from\nscratch by choosing Blank Web Database on the New page of the Backstage view.\nYou can also publish a regular database as a Web database, although the tables in\nthe database must conform to Web database requirements for publication to be\nsuccessful. Because of these requirements, if you work for an organization where\nfuture deployment of Access Services is a possibility, you might want to consider\ncreating a Web database to ensure that your database can be published to Access\nServices in the future.\nIn a Web database, you can create two kinds of objects:\n\u25cf Web objects These can be created and viewed in either a Web browser\nor Access.\n\u25cf Non-Web objects These can be created and viewed only in Access.\nWhen you are working with a Web database from a browser, you are working with\nthe database on the server. When you are working with it from Access, you are\nworking with a local copy of the database that is synchronized with the database\non the server. For both types of objects, you can make design changes only in\nAccess and only when connected to the server.\nThese days, more and more companies have employees and clients in different\ngeographic locations, and more and more people are working away from company\noffices. Web databases make it possible for people to access company databases\nfrom wherever they are and from any computer, whether or not it has Access\ninstalled.\n52 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\nCreating Databases and Tables Manually\nSuppose you need to store different types of information for different types of people.\nFor example, you might want to maintain information about employees, customers, and\nsuppliers. In addition to the standard information\u2014such as names, addresses, and phone\nnumbers\u2014you might want to track these other kinds of information:\n\u25cf Employee identification numbers, hire dates, marital status, deductions, and pay rates\n\u25cf Customer orders and account status\n\u25cf Supplier contacts, current order status, and discounts\nYou could start with a template, add fields for all the different items of information to\na single Contacts table, and then fill in only the relevant fields for each type of contact.\nHowever, cramming all this information into one table would soon get pretty messy. It\u2019s\nbetter to create a new database based on the Blank Database template and then manu-\nally create separate tables for each type of contact: employee, customer, and supplier.\nWhen you create a new blank database or insert a new table into an existing database,\nthe table is displayed on a tabbed page in Datasheet view with one empty row that is\nready to receive data. Because the active object is a table, Access adds the Table Tools\ncontextual tabs to the ribbon so that you can work with the table.\nA new table in a new database.\nCreating Databases and Tables Manually 53\nIf you close the table at this point, it will disappear, because it contains no data and it has\nno structure. The simplest way to make the table part of the database is to create at least\none record by entering data, which simultaneously defines the table\u2019s structure.\nTip You can also define the structure of the table without entering data. For information about\ntable structure, see \u201cRefining Table Structure\u201d later in this chapter. For information about\nadding new blank fields to a table, see \u201cRestricting the Type of Data\u201d in Chapter 6, \u201cMaintain\nData Integrity.\u201d\nObviously, to create a record, you need to know how to enter information in Datasheet view.\nField waiting for data\nPrimary key\nRecord selector, displaying New icon\nThe first record in a new table, before data is entered.\nEvery table has an empty row that is ready to receive a new record, as indicated by the New\nicon (the asterisk) in the record selector at the left end of the row. By default, the first field\nin each new table is an ID field designed to contain an entry that will uniquely identify the\nrecord. Also by default, this field is designated as the table\u2019s primary key. No two records\nin this table can have the same value in this primary key field. Behind the scenes, the data\ntype of this field is set to AutoNumber, so Access will enter a sequential number in this\nfield for you.\nTip As you\u2019ll see in a later exercise, the primary key field does not have to be the default\nAutoNumber type. If you need to you create your own primary key field, then anything\nmeaningful and unique will work.\nSee Also For information about data types, see \u201cRefining Table Structure\u201d later in this chapter.\nThe first field you need to be concerned about is the active field labeled Click To Add.\nYou enter the first item of information for the new record in the first cell in this field,\nand then press the Tab or Enter key to move to the first cell in the field to the right.\nAccess then assigns the value 1 to the ID field, assigns the name Field1 to the second\nfield, and moves the Click To Add label to the third field. The icon in the record selector\nat the left end of the record changes to two dots and a pencil to indicate that this\nrecord has not yet been saved, and the New icon moves to the record selector of the\nnext row.\n54 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\nThe first record in a new table, after data has been entered in the first field.\nWhen creating a new table in Datasheet view, you need to save the first record after\nentering the first item of data. If you don\u2019t, Access increments the ID value for each field\nyou add to that record. For example, if you add seven fields, Access assigns the value 7 to\nthe ID field of the first record. To avoid this problem, you simply click the icon in the record\nselector after you enter your first value in the first record. This saves the record with the\nvalue 1 assigned to the ID field, and subsequent records will be numbered sequentially.\nHaving entered the first item of data and saved the record, you continue entering items\nof information in consecutive cells and pressing Tab or Enter. When you finish entering the\nlast item for the first record, you click anywhere in the row below to tell Access that the\nrecord is complete.\nAfter you complete the first record of a new table, you will probably want to change the\ndefault field names to something more meaningful. To rename a field, you simply double-\nclick its field name and then type the name you want.\nAt any time while you are entering data in a new table, you can save the table by clicking\nthe Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar and naming the table. If you try to close the\ntable without explicitly saving it, Access prompts you to save the table. If you click No,\nAccess discards the table and any data you have entered.\nAfter you have saved the table for the first time, Access automatically saves each record\nwhen you move away from it. You don\u2019t have to worry about losing your changes, but you\ndo have to remember that most data entries can be undone only by editing the record.\nDatabases almost always contain more than one table. You can create additional empty\ntables by clicking the Table button in the Tables group on the Create tab of the ribbon.\nIf you need to create a table that is similar in structure to an existing one, you can copy\nand paste the existing table to create a new one. When you paste the table, Access gives\nyou the option of naming the table and of specifying whether you want the new table to\nhave the existing table\u2019s structure or both its structure and its data.\nCreating Databases and Tables Manually 55\nFor some kinds of tables, Access provides Quick Start fields that you can use to add\ncommon sets of fields or kinds of fields to a table. The Quick Start options take the\nwork out of defining these fields and can be very useful when you know exactly what\ntype of field you need.\nIn this exercise, you\u2019ll create a blank database, enter information into the first record of\nits default table, assign field names, add another record, and save and close the table.\nThen you\u2019ll copy that table to create a second one. Finally, you\u2019ll create a new table and\nexperiment with Quick Start fields.\nSET UP You don\u2019t need any practice files to complete this exercise. Close any open\ndatabases, and then with the New page of the Backstage view displayed, follow\nthe steps.\n1. In the center pane of the New page, in the Available Templates area, click Blank\nDatabase.\n2. In the right pane, click the File Name box, and type MyTables. Then click the\nBrowse button, navigate to your Chapter02 practice file folder, and click OK.\nTip You can\u2019t create a blank database without saving it. If you don\u2019t provide a file name\nand location, Access saves the file with the name Database followed by a sequential\nnumber in the default location (your Documents folder, unless you have changed it).\n3. In the right pane, click the Create button.\nAccess creates the blank database in the specified location, opens the database,\nand displays a new blank table named Table1.\n4. With the empty field below Click to Add selected, type Scott, and then press Tab\nto move to the next field.\nThe icon in the record selector changes to indicate that this record has not yet\nbeen saved. The value 1 appears in the ID field, the name of the second column\nchanges to Field1, and the Click To Add label moves to the third column.\n5. Click the icon in the record selector to save the record before you move on.\nTip Clicking the record selector is necessary only after you enter the first value in a\nnew table. This action sets the ID field value to 1.\n56 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\n6. Click the cell under Click to Add, and type the following information into the next\nseven cells, pressing Tab after each entry:\nGode\n612 E. 2nd\nPocatello\nID\n73204\nUSA\n208 555-0161\nAs the cursor moves to the next cell, the name of the field in which you just entered\ndata changes to Field followed by a sequential number.\nThe first complete record.\nTip Don\u2019t be concerned if your screen does not look exactly like ours. In this graphic,\nwe\u2019ve scrolled the page and adjusted the widths of the columns so that you can see all\nthe fields. For information about adjusting columns, see \u201cManipulating Table Columns\nand Rows\u201d later in this chapter.\n7. Double-click the ID field name (not the ID value in Field5), and then type\nCustomerID to rename it.\nTip Field names can include spaces, but the spaces can affect how queries have to be\nconstructed, so it is best not to include them. For readability, capitalize each word and\nthen remove the spaces, or use underscores instead of spaces.\n8. Repeat step 7 for the other fields, changing the field names to the following:\nField1 FirstName Field4 City Field7 Country\nField2 LastName Field5 State Field8 Phone\nField3 Street Field6 ZIP\nThe table now has intuitive field names.\nCreating Databases and Tables Manually 57\nThe renamed fields.\nTip Again, don\u2019t worry if your screen doesn\u2019t look exactly like this graphic, because\nwe\u2019ve made adjustments so that you can see all the fields.\n9. Add another record containing the following field values to the table, pressing Tab\nto move from field to field:\nFirstName John City Montreal Country Canada\nLastName Frederickson State Quebec Phone 514 555-0167\nStreet 43 rue St. Laurent ZIP (press Tab to skip this field)\n10. At the right end of the tab bar, click the Close button.\n11. When Access asks whether you want to save the design of the table, click Yes.\nImportant Clicking No will delete the new table and its data from the database.\nAccess displays the Save As dialog box.\nYou must save the table before closing it.\n12. In the Table Name box, type Customers, and then click OK.\nAccess closes the table, which is now listed in the Tables group on the Navigation bar.\nThe database now contains one table.\n58 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\nTip You can rename a table by right-clicking it in the Navigation pane and then clicking\nRename. You can delete a table by right-clicking it, clicking Delete, and then confirming\nthe deletion in the message box that appears. (You can also delete a table by selecting\nit in the Navigation bar and then clicking the Delete button in the Records group on\nthe Home tab or pressing the Delete key.)\n13. In the Navigation pane, click the Customers table to select it.\n14. On the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, click the Copy button. Then click the\nPaste button.\nKeyboard Shortcut Press Ctrl+C to copy data.

If you\u2019re cap-\nturing the same information in multiple places, that is a sure sign that you need\nto analyze the data and figure out a way to put the duplicated information in a\nseparate table.\nFor example, an Orders table should not include information about the customer\nplacing each order, for two significant reasons. First, if the same customer orders\nmore than once, all his or her information has to be repeated for each order, which\ninflates the size of the table and the database. Second, if the customer moves, his\nor her address will need to be updated in the record for every order placed.\nThe way to avoid this type of problem is to put customer information in a Customers\ntable and assign each customer a unique identifier, such as a sequential number or\nunique string of letters, in the primary key field. Then in the Orders table, you can\nidentify the customer by the unique ID. If you need to know the name and address\nof the customer who placed a particular order, you can have Access use the unique\nID to look up that information in the Customers table.\nThe process of ensuring that a set of information is stored in only one place is\ncalled normalization. This process tests a database for compliance with a set of\nnormalization rules that ask questions such as \u201cIf I know the information in the\nprimary key field of a record, can I retrieve information from one and only one\nrecord?\u201d For example, knowing that a customer\u2019s ID is 1002 means you can pull\nthe customer\u2019s name and address from the Customers table, whereas knowing\nthat a customer\u2019s last name is Jones does not mean that you can pull the cus-\ntomer\u2019s name and address from the table, because more than one customer\nmight have the last name Jones.\nThe topic of normalization is beyond the scope of this book. If you need to design\na database that will contain several tables, you should search for Database\ndesign basics in Access Help to learn more about the normalization process.\nManipulating Table Columns and Rows 61\nManipulating Table Columns and Rows\nIn Chapter 1, \u201cExplore an Access 2010 Database,\u201d we showed you how to quickly adjust\nthe width of table columns to efficiently display their data. In addition to adjusting column\nwidth, sometimes you might want to rearrange a table\u2019s fields to get a better view of the\ndata. For example, if you want to look up a phone number but the names and phone\nnumbers are several fields apart, you will have to scroll the page to get the information\nyou need. You might want to rearrange or hide a few fields to be able to simultaneously\nsee the ones you are interested in.\nYou can manipulate the columns and rows of an Access table without affecting the under-\nlying data in any way. You can size rows and size, hide, move, and freeze columns. You can\nsave your table formatting so that the table will look the same the next time you open it,\nor you can discard your changes without saving them.\nIn this exercise, you\u2019ll open a table and manipulate its columns and rows.\nSET UP You need the MyTables database you worked with in the preceding exercise\nto complete this exercise. Open the MyTables database, and then follow the steps.\n1. In the Navigation pane, double-click the Customers table to open it in\nDatasheet view.\n2. In the field name row, point to the right border of the Street field name, and\nwhen the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, drag to the right until\nyou can see all of the street addresses.\n3. Double-click the right border of any column that seems too wide or too narrow to\nadjust the column to fit its contents.\nThis technique is particularly useful in a large table where you can\u2019t easily determine\nthe length of a field\u2019s longest entry.\n4. Point to the border between any two record selectors, and drag downward.\nWhen you release the mouse button, Access increases the height of all rows\nin the table.\n62 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\nYou cannot adjust the height of a single row.\n5. On the Home tab, in the Records group, click the More button, and then click\nRow Height.\nThe Row Height dialog box opens.\nYou can set the rows to the precise height you want.\n6. In the Row Height dialog box, select the Standard Height check box, and then\nclick OK.\nAccess resets the height of the rows to the default setting.\n7. Click anywhere in the FirstName field. Then in the Records group, click the More\nbutton, and click Hide Fields.\nThe FirstName field disappears, and the fields to its right shift to the left.\nTip If you select several fields before clicking Hide Fields, they all disappear. You can\nselect adjacent fields by clicking the field name of the first one, holding down the Shift\nkey, and then clicking the field name of the last one. The two fields and any fields in\nbetween are selected.\n8. To restore the hidden field, in the Records group, click the More button, and then\nclick Unhide Fields.\nManipulating Table Columns and Rows 63\nThe Unhide Columns dialog box opens.\nYou can select and clear check boxes to control which fields are visible.\nTip If you want to hide several columns that are not adjacent, you can display the\nUnhide Columns dialog box and clear their checkboxes.\n9. In the Unhide Columns dialog box, select the FirstName check box, and then\nclick Close.\nAccess redisplays the FirstName field.\n10. If you can see all of the fields in the table, for the purposes of this exercise, adjust\nthe size of the program window until some of the fields are no longer visible.\n11. Point to the CustomerID field name, hold down the mouse button, and drag through\nthe FirstName and LastName field names. With the three columns selected, click the\nMore button in the Records group, and then click Freeze Fields.\n12. Scroll the page to the right until the Phone field is adjacent to the LastName field.\nThe first three columns remain in view as you scroll.\n13. In the Records group, click More, and then click Unfreeze All Fields to restore the\nfields to their normal condition.\nTip The commands to hide, unhide, freeze, and unfreeze columns are also available\nfrom the shortcut menu that appears when you right-click a field name.\n64 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\n14. Click the Phone field name to select that field. Then drag the field to the left,\nreleasing the mouse button when the thick black line appears to the right of the\nLastName field.\n15. Close the Customers table, clicking Yes to save the changes you have made to\nthe column widths and order. If you see a warning that this action will clear the\nClipboard, click Yes.\nCLEAN UP Retain the MyTables database for use in later exercises.\nRefining Table Structure\nAlthough you can create the structure of a database in Datasheet view, some structural\nrefinements can be carried out only in Design view. When you are familiar with tables,\nyou might even want to create your tables from scratch in Design view, where you\nhave more control over the fields. You can open a new table in Design view by clicking\nthe Table Design button in the Tables group on the Create tab.\nWhen you open an existing table in Design view, the tabbed page shows the underlying\nstructure of the table.\nThe table design page.\nRefining Table Structure 65\nThis page has two parts. The top part consists of the following:\n\u25cf Selector You can click the shaded box at the left end of a row to select the entire\nfield. You can then insert a row above the selected one, delete the row (thereby\ndeleting the field), or drag the row up or down to reposition its field in the table.\nThe selector also identifies the primary key field of the table by displaying the\nPrimary Key icon (a key with a right-pointing arrow).\nTip If you don\u2019t want a table to have a primary key (for example, if none of the fields\nwill contain a unique value for every record), select the field designated as the primary\nkey, and on the Design contextual tab, in the Tools group, click the Primary Key button\nto toggle it off. If you want to designate a different field as the primary key, select the\nnew field, and click the Primary Key button to toggle it on. (You don\u2019t have to remove\nthe primary key from the current field first; it will happen automatically.)\n\u25cf Field Name column This column contains the names you specified when you created\nthe table. You can edit the names by using regular text-editing techniques. You can\nadd a new field by typing its name in the first empty cell in this column.\n\u25cf Data Type column This column specifies the type of data that the field can contain. By\ndefault, the ID field in a new table is assigned the AutoNumber data type, and all other\nfields are assigned the Text data type. With the exception of fields with the OLE Object\nand Attachment data types, you can change the type of any field by clicking its Data\nType entry, clicking the arrow that appears, and clicking a new data type in the list.\nThe list of data types.\nSee also For more information about data types, see \u201cRestricting the Type of Data\u201d in\nChapter 6, \u201cMaintain Data Integrity.\u201d\n\u25cf Description column This column contains an optional description of the field.\n66 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\nThe Field Properties area at the bottom of the design page displays the properties of the\nfield selected in the top part. Different properties are associated with different data\ntypes. They can determine such things as the number of characters allowed in a field,\nthe value inserted if the user doesn't type an entry, and whether an entry is required.\nProperties can also assess whether an entry is valid and can force the user to select\nfrom a list of values rather than typing them (with the risk of errors).\nAll fields, no matter what their data type, can be assigned a Caption property that will\nappear in the place of the field name in tables or in other database objects. For example,\nyou might want to use captions to display the names of fields with spaces, such as First\nName for the FirstName field.\nSee Also For information about using properties to control the accuracy of data entry, see\nChapter 6, \u201cMaintain Data Integrity.\u201d For a comprehensive list of data types and properties,\nsearch on data types in Access Help.\nIn this exercise, you\u2019ll open a table in Design view, add and delete fields, change a data\ntype, set field sizes, and add a caption.\nSET UP You need the MyTables database you worked with in the preceding exercise\nto complete this exercise. Open the MyTables database, and then follow the steps.\n1. In the Navigation pane, right-click the Employees table, and then click Design\nView.\nAccess opens the table with its structure displayed. Because you created this table\nby copying the Customers table, you need to make some structural changes.\n2. With CustomerID highlighted in the Field Name column, type EmployeeID, and\nthen press the Tab key twice.\n3. In the Description column, type Unique identifying number.\n4. Click the Country field\u2019s selector, and then on the Design contextual tab, in the\nTools group, click the Delete Rows button.\n5. In the empty row below the Phone field, click the Field Name cell, and type\nBirthdate. Then click the Data Type cell.\nAccess assigns the default Text data type to the new field.\n6. Click the arrow at the right end of the Data Type cell, and in the list, click\nDate/Time.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to add another Date/Time field named DateHired.\nRefining Table Structure 67\n8. Select the ZIP field name, change it to PostalCode, and then change its data type\nto Text.\nTip If you use only five-digit ZIP codes, the Number data type is fine. But setting it to\nText allows you to enter ZIP+4 codes or the letter-number postal codes used in Canada\nand other countries.\nThe properties in the Field Properties area at the bottom of the design page\nchange to those that are appropriate for this type of field.\nThe properties for the Text data type.\n9. In the box to the right of Field Size, double-click 255, and type 10.\nYou are specifying that this field can contain no more than 10 characters.\n10. Change the Field Size property of the following fields as shown:\nFirstName 50 City 50 Phone 30\nLastName 50 State 20\nTip Sometimes changing the field properties of a table that already contains data can\nproduce unanticipated results. If you make a change to a field property that might cause\ndata to be lost (for example, if you make the Field Size property smaller than one of the\nfield\u2019s existing values), Access warns you of this problem when you attempt to save the\ntable. For more information, see Chapter 6, \u201cMaintain Data Integrity.\u201d\n68 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\n11. Click the State field. Then in the Field Properties area, click the Caption box, and\ntype State or Region.\nThe Field Name remains State, but in Datasheet view, the column heading will be\nState or Region.\nYou have changed the Field Size and Caption properties of the State field.\n12. On the Design tab, in the Views group, click the View button to switch to\nDatasheet view.\nAccess tells you that you must save the table before leaving Design view.\n13. In the message box, click Yes to save the table.\nAccess saves the table and displays it in Datasheet view.\n14. With the table displayed in Datasheet view, click the LastName field name. Then\non the Fields contextual tab, in the Add & Delete group, click the Text button.\nA new field called Field1 that has the Text data type is inserted to the right of the\nLastName field.\nTip You can also create a new field with a specific data type by clicking the Click To Add\nlabel to the right of the last field in the field name row. Then in the list that appears, you\ncan click the data type you want.\nCreating Relationships Between Tables 69\n15. With Field1 selected, type Title, and press Enter.\n16. Click the Title field name. Then in the Properties group, in the Field Size box, click\n255 to select it, type 50, and press Enter.\n17. Type the following information in the first record:\nFirstName Karen\nLastName Berg\nTitle Owner\nThe Employees table is now ready for you to start entering data.\nThe first record of the Employees table.\nCLEAN UP Close the Employees table. Retain the MyTables database for use in the\nlast exercise.\nCreating Relationships Between Tables\nIn Access, a relationship is an association between common fields in two tables. You can\nuse this association to link the primary key field in one table to a field that contains the\nsame information in another table. The field in the other table is called the foreign key.\nFor example, if customer accounts are assigned to specific sales employees, you can\nestablish a relationship by linking the primary key EmployeeID field in the Employees\ntable with the foreign key EmployeeID field in the Customers table. Each customer\naccount is assigned to only one employee, but each employee can manage many\ncustomer accounts, so this type of relationship\u2014the most common\u2014is known as\na one-to-many relationship.\nSimilarly, if every order is associated with a customer, you can establish a relationship\nby linking the primary key CustomerID field in the Customers table and foreign key\nCustomerID field in the Orders table. Each order is placed by only one customer, but\neach customer can place many orders. So again, this is a one-to-many relationship.\n70 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\nLess common relationships include:\n\u25cf One-to-one In this type of relationship, each record in one table can have one and\nonly one related record in the other table. This type of relationship isn\u2019t commonly\nused because it is easier to put all the fields in one table. However, you might use\ntwo related tables instead of one to break up a table with many fields, or to track\ninformation that applies to only some of the records in the first table.\n\u25cf Many-to-many This type of relationship is really two one-to-many relationships\ntied together through a third table. You might see this relationship in a database\nthat contains Products, Orders, and Order Details tables. The Products table has one\nrecord for each product, and each product has a unique ProductID. The Orders table\nhas one record for each order placed, and each record in it has a unique OrderID.\nHowever, the Orders table doesn\u2019t specify which products were included in each\norder; that information is in the Order Details table\u2014the table in the middle that\nties the other two tables together. Products and Orders each have a one-to-many\nrelationship with Order Details. Products and Orders therefore have a many-to-\nmany relationship with each other. In plain language, this means that every product\ncan appear in many orders, and every order can include many products.\nThe most common way of creating a relationship between two tables is to add the\ntables to the Relationships page displayed when you click the Relationships button in\nthe Relationships group on the Database Tools tab. You then drag a field in one table\nto the common field in the other table and complete the relationship definition in the\nEdit Relationships dialog box. In this dialog box, you are given the opportunity to im-\npose a restriction called referential integrity on the data, which means that an entry\nwill not be allowed in one table unless it already exists in the other table.\nAfter you have created a relationship, you can delete it by deleting the line connecting\nthe tables on the Relationships page. You can clear all the boxes from the page by\nclicking the Clear Layout button in the Tools group on the Relationship Tools Design\ncontextual tab.\nCreating Relationships Between Tables 71\nTip The coverage of relationships in this topic is deliberately simple. However, relationships\nare what make relational databases tick, and Access provides a number of fairly complex\nmechanisms to ensure the integrity of the data on either end of the relationship. Some of\nthese mechanisms are covered in Chapter 6, \u201cMaintain Data Integrity.\u201d For a good overview,\nsearch for Guide to table relationships in Access Help.\nIn this exercise, you\u2019ll create relationships between one table and two other tables.\nThen you\u2019ll test the referential integrity of one of the relationships.\nSET UP You need the MyTables database you worked with in the preceding exercise\nto complete this exercise. Open the MyTables database, and then follow the steps.\n1. On the Create tab, in the Tables group, click the Table button to create a new\ntable.\nBefore we add fields to this table, let\u2019s save it.\n2. On the Quick Access Toolbar, click the Save button, name the table Orders, and\nclick OK.\n3. To the right of Click to Add, click the arrow, and in the data type list, click\nNumber. Repeat this step to create a second field with the Number data type.\n4. Double-click Field1, and type CustomerID. Then double-click Field2, and type\nEmployeeID.\nEach order in the Orders table will be placed by one customer and will be handled\nby one employee. Let\u2019s create relationships between the Orders table and the\nCustomers and Employees tables so that we don\u2019t create records for orders from\ncustomers who don\u2019t exist or that seem to have been handled by employees who\ndon\u2019t exist.\n5. Close the Orders table.\nTip You cannot create a relationship for an open table.\n6. On the Database Tools tab, in the Relationships group, click the Relationships\nbutton.\nThe Show Table dialog box opens so that you can indicate the tables for which\nyou want to create a relationship.\nTroubleshooting If the dialog box doesn\u2019t open automatically, click the Show Table\nbutton in the Relationships group on the Design contextual tab.\n72 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\nThe Tables page of the Show Table dialog box.\n7. With Customers selected on the Tables page, click Add. Then double-click\nOrders, and click Close.\nAccess displays the Relationships page and adds a Relationship Tools contextual tab\nto the ribbon.\nThe two boxes list all the fields in their respective tables.\nCreating Relationships Between Tables 73\n8. In the Customers field list, click CustomerID, and drag it down and over\nCustomerID in the Orders field list, releasing the mouse button when two\nlittle boxes, one containing a plus sign, appear below the pointer.\nThe Edit Relationships dialog box opens.\nAt the bottom of the dialog box, Access indicates that this will be a one-to-many relationship.\n9. Select the Enforce Referential Integrity check box, and then click Create.\nAccess creates the link between the primary key in the Customers table and the\nforeign key in the Orders table, and a line now connects the two field lists on\nthe Relationships page.\nThe symbols at each end of the line indicate that each Customer ID value appears only once\nin the Customers table but can appear many times in the Orders table.\n74 Chapter 2 Create Databases and Simple Tables\n10. On the Design contextual tab, in the Relationships group, click the Show Table\nbutton. Then in the Show Table dialog box, double-click the Employees table, and\nclick Close.\nAccess adds a box listing all the fields in the Employees table to the Relationships\npage.\n11. On the page, drag the title bars of the three field lists to arrange them so that\nthey are side by side and equidistant.\n12. In the Employees field list, click the EmployeeID field, and drag it down and over\nthe EmployeeID field in the Orders field list. Then in the Edit Relationships dialog\nbox, select the Enforce Referential Integrity check box, and click Create.\n13. After Access draws the relationship line between the primary key and the foreign\nkey, close the Relationships page, clicking Yes to save its layout.\n14. Open the Orders table. Then in the CustomerID field of the first record, type 11,\nand click below the record to complete it.\nAccess displays a message box telling you that you cannot add the new record to\nthe table.\nThe value in the CustomerID field in the Orders table must match a value in the primary key\nCustomerID field in the Customer table.\n15. Click OK. Then change the value to 1, and click below the record to complete it.\nThis time, Access accepts the value because there is a record with the value 1 in the\nprimary key CustomerID field of the Customers table.\nCLEAN UP Close the Orders table, and then close the My Tables database.\nKey Points 75\nKey Points\n\u25cf Access 2010 includes templates to help you create databases and application parts\nto help you add related tables and other database objects.\n\u25cf Rather than storing all information in one table, you can create different tables for\neach type of information, such as customers, orders, and suppliers.\n\u25cf You can create a simple table structure by entering data and naming fields in\nDatasheet view. You can also set the data type and certain properties.\n\u25cf You can manipulate or hide columns and rows without affecting the data.\n\u25cf In Design view, you can modify any table, whether you created it manually or as\npart of a template.\n\u25cf Data types and properties determine what data can be entered in a field, and how\nthe data will look on the screen. Caution: changing some properties might affect\nthe data.\n\u25cf You can create a relationship between the primary key field of one table and the\nforeign key field of another so that you can combine information from both tables.\nChapter at a Glance\nCreate reports by\nusing a wizard, page 122\nModify report design,\npage 129\nPreview and print\nreports, page 136\n5\nCreate Simple\nReports\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to\n\u2714 Create reports by using a wizard.\n\u2714 Modify report design.\n\u2714 Preview and print reports.\nLike forms, reports give people easy access to the information stored in a database.\nHowever, there are several differences between forms and reports, including the following:\n\u25cf Forms are used to enter, view, and edit information. Reports are used only to view\ninformation.\n\u25cf Forms are usually displayed on-screen. Reports can be previewed on the screen,\nbut they are usually printed.\n\u25cf Forms generally provide a detailed look at records and are usually for the people who\nactually work with the database. Reports are often used to group and summarize\ndata, and are often for people who don\u2019t work with the database but who use the\ninformation stored in the database for other business tasks.\nReports usually present summaries of larger bodies of information. For example, your\ndatabase might hold detailed information about thousands of orders. If you want to edit\nthose orders or enter new ones, you can do so directly in the table or through a form.\nIf you want to summarize those orders to illustrate the rate of growth of the company\u2019s\nsales, you generate a report.\nLike a book report or an annual report of a company\u2019s activities, a report created in\nMicrosoft Access 2010 is typically used to summarize and organize information to\nexpress a particular point of view to a specific audience. When you are designing a\nreport, it is important to consider the point you are trying to make, the intended\naudience, and the level of information they will need.\n121\n122 Chapter 5 Create Simple Reports\nIn this chapter, you\u2019ll create a report by using a wizard. After modifying the layout and\ncontent of the report, you\u2019ll see how it will look when printed.\nPractice Files Before you can complete the exercises in this chapter, you need to copy\nthe book\u2019s practice files to your computer. The practice file you\u2019ll use to complete the\nexercises in this chapter is in the Chapter05 practice file folder. A complete list of\npractice files is provided in \u201cUsing the Practice Files\u201d at the beginning of this book.\nCreating Reports by Using a Wizard\nYou can divide the content of an Access report into two general categories: information\nderived from records in one or more tables, and everything else. The everything else\ncategory includes the title, page headers and footers, introductory and explanatory text,\nand any logos and other graphics.\nJust as you can create a form that includes all the fields in a table by using the Form\ntool, you can create a report that includes all the fields by using the Report tool, which\nis located in the Reports group on the Create tab. But such a report is merely a prettier\nversion of the table, and it does not summarize the data in any meaningful way. You are\nmore likely to want to create a report based on only some of the fields, and that is a job\nfor the Report wizard.\nTip In addition to basing a report on a table, you can base it on the datasheet created when\nyou run a query. For information about queries, see Chapter 8, \u201cCreate Queries.\u201d\nThe Report wizard leads you through a series of questions and then creates a report based\non your answers. So the first step in creating a report is to consider the end result you want\nand what information you need to include in the report to achieve that result. After you\nprovide that information, the wizard creates a simple report layout and adds a text box\ncontrol and its associated label for each field you specify.\nFor example, you might want to use a Products table as the basis for a report that groups\nproducts by category. When you give the grouping instruction to the wizard, it first sorts\nthe table based on the category, and then sorts the products in each category. In the\nspace at the top of each group (called the group header), the wizard inserts the name of\nthe category.\nIn this exercise, you\u2019ll use the Report wizard to create a simple report that displays an\nalphabetical list of products.\nCreating Reports by Using a Wizard 123\nSET UP You need the GardenCompany05_start database located in your Chapter05\npractice file folder to complete this exercise. Open the GardenCompany05_start\ndatabase, and save it as GardenCompany05. Then follow the steps.\n1. With All Access Objects displayed in the Navigation pane, under Tables, click\n(don\u2019t double-click) Categories.\n2. On the Create tab, in the Reports group, click the Report button.\nAccess creates a report based on all the fields in the Categories table, displays the\nreport in Layout view, and adds four Report Layout Tools contextual tabs to the\nribbon.\nThe default report created by the Report tool.\nTroubleshooting The appearance of buttons and groups on the ribbon changes depending\non the width of the program window. For information about changing the appearance of\nthe ribbon to match our screen images, see \u201cModifying the Display of the Ribbon\u201d at the\nbeginning of this book.\n124 Chapter 5 Create Simple Reports\n3. This is not the report we want, so close the Categories report, clicking No when\nprompted to save it.\n4. On the Create tab, in the Reports group, click the Report Wizard button.\nThe Report wizard starts. Because the Categories table is still selected in the\nNavigation pane, that table is specified in the Tables/Queries box and its fields\nare listed in the Available Fields box.\n5. Display the Tables/Queries list, and then click Table: Products.\nThe Available Fields box now lists the fields in the Products table.\nThe first page of the Report wizard with the correct table selected.\n6. In the Available Fields list, double-click ProductName, QuantityPerUnit, and\nUnitsInStock to move them to the Selected Fields box.\nTip Fields appear in a report in the order in which they appear in the Selected Fields list.\nYou can save yourself the effort of rearranging the fields in the report by entering them\nin the desired order in the wizard.\nCreating Reports by Using a Wizard 125\n7. At the bottom of the page, click Next.\nThe wizard asks whether you want to group the records. When you group by a\nfield, the report inserts a group header at the top of each group of records that\nhave the same value in that field.\n8. In the field list on the left, double-click ProductName.\nIn the preview pane on the right, the wizard moves ProductName into the group\nheader area to show that records will be grouped by this field.\n9. In the lower-left corner of the page, click Grouping Options.\nThe Grouping Intervals dialog box opens.\nYou can refine the grouping specification in this dialog box.\n10. Display the Grouping intervals list, click 1st Letter, and then click OK.\nThe group header now indicates the grouping interval you have assigned to the\ngrouping field.\n126 Chapter 5 Create Simple Reports\nThe types of grouping intervals available vary depending on the data type of the field by\nwhich you are grouping records.\n11. Click Next.\nThe wizard asks how you want to sort and summarize the records.\nYou can sort by up to four fields, each in ascending or descending order.\nCreating Reports by Using a Wizard 127\nTip For any field that contains numeric information, you can click Summary Options\nnear the bottom of the wizard page to display the Summary Options dialog box, where\nyou can instruct Access to insert a group footer in the report and to display the sum,\naverage, minimum, or maximum value for the field. The only numeric field in this report\nis UnitsInStock, and it is not appropriate to summarize that field.\n12. Click the arrow to the right of the 1 box to display a list of fields, and click\nProductName. Then click Next.\nThe wizard asks which of three layouts and which orientation you want for this\nreport.\nThe preview on the left shows the effect of the options on the right.\n13. In the Layout area, click each option in turn to see a preview in the report thumbnail\nto the left.\n14. When you have finished exploring, click Outline.\n15. With Portrait selected in the Orientation area and the Adjust the field width so\nall fields fit on a page check box selected, click Next.\nThe wizard prompts you to supply a title for the report.\n128 Chapter 5 Create Simple Reports\nFor ease of use, you should make the title more specific.\n16. In the title box, type Alphabetical List of Products, and then with Preview the\nreport selected, click Finish.\nAccess creates the report and displays it in Print Preview.\nThe new report in Print Preview.\n17. Page through the nine-page report, noticing how it is arranged. Then close it.\nCLEAN UP Retain the GardenCompany05 database for use in later exercises.\nModifying Report Design 129\nModifying Report Design\nYou can use the Report wizard to get a quick start on a report, but you will frequently want\nto modify the report to get the result you need. As with forms, the report consists of text\nbox controls that are bound to the corresponding fields in the underlying table and their\nassociated labels. You can add labels, text boxes, images, and other controls, and you can\nformat them, either by using commands on the ribbon or by setting their properties in\nthe report\u2019s Property Sheet.\nTip Property Sheets for reports work the same way as those for forms. For information, see\n\u201cChanging the Look of Forms\u201d in Chapter 3, \u201cCreate Simple Forms.\u201d\nYou can adjust the layout and content of reports in either Layout view or Design view.\nFor simple adjustments, it is easier to work in Layout view, where you can see the layout\nwith live data, making the process more intuitive.\nSee Also For information about creating and modifying reports in Design view, see Chapter 9,\n\u201cCreate Custom Reports.\u201d\nTip Automatic error checking identifies common errors in forms and reports and gives you a\nchance to fix them. For example, Access informs you if a report is wider than the page it will\nbe printed on. Error checking is turned on by default. If you want to turn it off, display the\nBackstage view, and click Options to open the Access Options dialog box. In the left pane,\nclick Object Designers, clear the error-checking check boxes at the bottom of the page, and\nthen click OK.\nIn this exercise, you\u2019ll modify the layout of a report. You\u2019ll then apply a theme, change\nsome of the colors, and dress up the text with character formatting. You will also apply\na simple rule that formats values differently if they meet a specific criterion.\nSET UP You need the GardenCompany05 database you worked with in the preceding\nexercise to complete this exercise. Open the GardenCompany05 database, and then\nfollow the steps.\n1. In the Navigation pane, under Reports, right-click the Alphabetical List of\nProducts report, and then click Print Preview.\n2. Maximize the program window if it isn\u2019t already maximized, and then point to\nthe previewed report page.\nThe pointer changes to a magnifying glass with a plus sign in it.\n130 Chapter 5 Create Simple Reports\nIn Print Preview, the magnifying glass pointer indicates that you can zoom in on the page.\n3. Click the previewed page once to zoom in.\nTip You can also zoom in and out by dragging the Zoom slider in the lower-right corner\nof the program window. The current zoom level appears to the left of the slider.\nNotice that the report has the following design problems:\n\u274d Extraneous text\n\u274d Spacey arrangement\n\u274d Uninviting formatting\nTo fix these problems, we need to switch to Layout view.\n4. On the View Shortcuts toolbar, click the Layout View button.\nAccess adds four Report Layout Tools contextual tabs to the ribbon. First let\u2019s work\nwith the group header controls.\nModifying Report Design 131\n5. On the Design contextual tab, in the Grouping & Totals group, click the Hide\nDetails button.\nThe controls that are bound to fields in the Products table are hidden so that you\ncan concentrate on the group header controls.\n6. Below the title, click ProductName by 1s, and press the Delete key.\nThe label is removed from all the group headers.\n7. Click the control containing A, and drag it to the left edge of the header.\nWhen you release the mouse button, all the corresponding controls move to the\ncorresponding location in their own group headers.\nKeyboard Shortcut Hold down the Alt key and press the Arrow keys to move the\nselected control in small increments. When the shadow box is positioned where you\nwant it, click away from the control.\nSee Also For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see \u201cKeyboard Shortcuts\u201d at\nthe end of this book.\n8. Point to the right border of the selected A control, and when the pointer changes\nto a double-headed arrow, drag to the left until the control is just big enough to\nhold its contents.\nAgain, all the corresponding controls assume the new size.\nIt is easier to work with the controls in the group header when the report details are hidden.\n132 Chapter 5 Create Simple Reports\n9. With the A control still selected, hold down the Shift key, and in turn, click the\nProduct Name, Quantity Per Unit, and Units In Stock label controls to add\nthem to the selection.\n10. On the Design tab, in the Tools group, click the Property Sheet button.\nThe Property Sheet opens.\nBecause more than one control is selected, the Selection Type of this Property Sheet is\nMultiple Selection.\n11. On the Format page of the Property Sheet, in the Top property box, type 0.25\u201d,\nand press Enter. Then close the Property Sheet.\nIn the group header, the letter control and label controls are now aligned 0.25 inch\nfrom the top of the header, and the height of the header has decreased because less\nspace is needed to accommodate the controls.\nModifying Report Design 133\nNow let\u2019s see how the group header looks with its data.\n12. In the Grouping & Totals group, click the Hide Details button to turn it off and\ndisplay the data from the table.\nThe numbers in the Units In Stock column are right-aligned. Let\u2019s center them.\n13. Click the first text box control under the Units In Stock label, and on the Format\ncontextual tab, in the Font group, click the Center button.\nNow we\u2019ll add some color and format the text.\n14. On the Design contextual tab, in the Themes group, click the Themes button, and\nin the gallery, click the Austin thumbnail.\nAlthough nothing much appears to change, the report takes on the color scheme\nand font scheme assigned to the selected theme.\n15. Inside the shaded area of the report header, but away from the title, click a blank\narea. On the Format contextual tab, in the Control Formatting group, click the\nShape Fill button. Then under Theme Colors in the palette, click the third box\n(Light Green, Background 2).\nWhen you created this report, alternate group headers were shaded with the\nsame color as alternate data rows. This coloring confuses rather than clarifies the\nreport structure. Let\u2019s turn off this alternate group header color.\n16. Click outside the dotted border to the left of the first group header. In the Back-\nground group, click the Alternate Row Color arrow, and at the bottom of the\npalette, click No Color.\n17. In the Control Formatting group, click the Shape Fill button, and in the palette,\nclick a light brown color.\nThe entire group header is shaded except the alphabet controls (A, B, C, and so on)\nthat you moved earlier. If you wanted to shade them as well, you could select one\nof them and repeat step 17 to apply the light brown fill.\n18. Click outside the dotted border to the left of the first row of data in the report, and\nremove the alternate row color of the data rows. Then click the white space above\nthe report header to see the result.\nOnly the backgrounds of the report header and group headers are now colored.\n134 Chapter 5 Create Simple Reports\nRemoving the alternate row color makes the structure of this report more obvious.\nTip Above the first object and below the last object of a report in Layout view are\nthe only places you can click that don\u2019t select at least one object on the report.\n19. Click any control, and then in the Selection group, click the Select All button.\nKeyboard Shortcut Press Ctrl+A to select all the controls.\n20. In the Font group, click the Font Size arrow, and then click 9.\nTip It is usually most efficient to change the character formatting of all the controls\nand then adjust the ones you want to be different.\n21. Click the report\u2019s title control, and then use the commands in the Font group\nto make the text 24 points, bold, and dark green.\n22. Select the controls in the group header, and make them bold and dark green.\n23. Scroll down the report, noticing that a few of the values in the Units In Stock\ncolumn are 0.\nWe want these values to stand out in the report to remind buyers that it is time\nto order more of these products.\n24. Click any control in the Units In Stock column. Then in the Control Formatting\ngroup, click the Conditional Formatting button.\nThe Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box opens.\n25. Click New Rule.\nModifying Report Design 135\nThe New Formatting Rule dialog box opens.\nYou can create rules that compare the current field value to a specific value or to other values\nin the same field.\n26. With Check values in the current record or use an expression selected as the\nrule type, in the Format only cells where the area, click the arrow for the second\nbox, and click less than. Then in the third box, type 1.\n27. In the bottom area, click the Bold button, and change the Font color setting to\nred. Then click OK.\nIn the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box, the rule is listed in the\nRule column with the formatting that will be applied to values that meet the rule\u2019s\ncriteria in the Format column.\nValues that are less than 1 will be bold and red.\n136 Chapter 5 Create Simple Reports\n28. Click OK. Then scroll down the report again, noticing that all the 0 values are\nnow bold and red.\n29. Close the report, clicking Yes to save your changes to its design.\nCLEAN UP Retain the GardenCompany05 database for use in the last exercise.\nPreviewing and Printing Reports\nUsing Print Preview to preview Access reports is very similar to using this view in other\nMicrosoft Office 2010 programs. If you preview your reports carefully, you won\u2019t have\nany major surprises when you print them.\nWhen previewing reports, you will want to pay special attention to how the pages break.\nIn a grouped report, you can control whether group headings are allowed to appear at the\nbottom of a page with no data and whether groups are allowed to break across pages.\nYou can make changes to the setup of your report pages from the Page Setup contex-\ntual tab in Layout view or from the tab displayed when you switch to Print Preview. For\nexample, you can specify the following:\n\u25cf Paper size\n\u25cf Margins\n\u25cf Orientation\n\u25cf Number of columns\n\u25cf Whether Access should print the report's structural elements or only its data\nYou can also click the Page Setup button to display the Page Setup dialog box, where you\ncan change all these settings in one place, as well as make additional refinements.\nWhen you are ready to print, you click the Print button on the Print Preview tab of the rib-\nbon to display the Print dialog box. You can also display the Print page of the Backstage\nview and then print one copy of the report with the default print settings by clicking the\nQuick Print button.\nIn this exercise, you\u2019ll preview a report, and you\u2019ll specify that groups should not break\nacross pages. Then you\u2019ll explore the available page setup and printing options.\nSET UP You need the GardenCompany05 database you worked with in the preceding\nexercise to complete this exercise. Open the GardenCompany05 database, and then\nfollow the steps.\n1. In the Navigation pane, right click the Alphabetical List of Products report, and\nthen click Print Preview.\nPreviewing and Printing Reports 137\nOnly the Print Preview tab appears on the ribbon.\n2. On the page navigation bar at the bottom of the window, click the Next Page\nbutton repeatedly to view each page of this report.\nBecause of the changes you made to the report in the previous exercise, the report\nis now six pages. Several of the groups start on one page and continue on the next\npage. For readability, let\u2019s fix this layout problem.\nThe group at the top of this page is a continuation of one that started\non the previous page.\n3. Switch to Layout view, and then on the Design tab, in the Grouping & Totals\ngroup, click the Group & Sort button.\nThe Group, Sort, And Total pane opens at the bottom of the report page.\nYou can use this pane to quickly add grouping and sorting levels and set related properties.\n4. In the Group, Sort, and Total pane, in the Group on ProductName bar, click More.\n138 Chapter 5 Create Simple Reports\nAccess displays additional options.\nThese are the current grouping settings.\n5. Click the do not keep group together on one page arrow, and in the list, click\nkeep whole group together on one page. Then close the Group, Sort, and\nTotal pane by clicking the Group & Sort button again.\n6. Switch to Print Preview, and page through the report.\nNow none of the groups is broken across pages. However, the report would look\nbetter with wider top, left, and right margins.\n7. On the Print Preview tab, in the Page Layout group, click the Page Setup button.\nThe Page Setup dialog box opens.\nThe Print Options page of the Page Setup dialog box.\nKey Points 139\n8. Click the Page tab, and verify that the paper size is Letter.\n9. Return to the Print Options page, and change the Top, Left, and Right margins to\n0.75. Then click OK.\n10. Scroll through the report to see the results.\nAlthough all the data in the report fits on the page, the page number in the footer\nis set too far to the right and is producing extra pages.\n11. Switch to Layout view, scroll down to the bottom of the report, and then scroll to\nthe right until you can see the page number.\n12. Click the page number control, and move and resize it so that it aligns approximately\nwith the Units In Stock column heading.\n13. Switch to Print Preview, and page through the report.\nThe report now fits neatly on seven pages.\n14. If you want, print the report by using the same techniques you would use to print\nany database object.\n15. Close the report, clicking Yes to save your changes.\nCLEAN UP Close the GardenCompany05 database.\nKey Points\n\u25cf When designing a report, consider the point you are trying to make, the intended\naudience, and the level of detail needed.\n\u25cf You can create a report that displays only some of the fields in a table by using the\nReport wizard. The report can be sorted and grouped to summarize the data in a\ntable in a meaningful way.\n\u25cf You can refine a report in Layout view by manipulating its controls and setting\nits properties. You can also format the controls to structure and highlight data.\n\u25cf In Print Preview, you can see how the report will look when printed and make\nadjustments before you print."
